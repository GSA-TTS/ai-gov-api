# 002: SSO Design for API System

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-06

## Context

- Single Sign-On (SSO) permits users to access multiple applications and services with a single set of login credentials. In the context of cloud-based services, which combine various networked devices and platforms (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), SSO simplifies user access, enhances security by reducing password fatigue and the use of weak or reused passwords, and streamlines identity management for organizations.
- AI.gov needs an architectural decision record documenting its approach to authentication across the shared service offering. Most agencies will likely want to utilize their existing single sign-on capabilities using established patterns such as SAML 2.0 or OIDC.

## Options considered

1. Federated Identity Systems
2. Credential Managers
3. API Gateway
4. Embedded Policy Decision Point
5. Blockchain-Enabled Federated Identity
6. Zero Trust Architecture

## Method used

The analysis incorporates considerations for Application Programming Interface (API) security, referencing OWASP API Top 10 risks, and addresses emerging challenges like quantum computing threats and the integration of Agentic AI systems using protocols such as MCP and A2A. Each pattern is evaluated based on its pros, cons, vulnerabilities, solutions, API support, cost-benefit trade-offs, and suitability for future Agentic AI use cases.

- Please see [Revisit OWASP API Top 10 in The Age of Agentic AI](https://medium.com/@tom.nguyen_5888/revisit-owasp-api-top-10-in-the-age-of-agentic-ai-bceb03dcf92f) for a technical discussion about the importance of a proper API system design towards future use of Agentic AI.

## Decision

Based on the analysis, particularly considering cost-effectiveness and future suitability for Agentic AI:

1. **Federated Identity Systems (FIS) with OAuth 2.0/OIDC:** Offers the most standardized and widely adopted approach for delegated authorization, crucial for both traditional APIs and emerging agent protocols like A2A. While requiring moderate implementation effort, it provides a scalable foundation for managing user and potentially agent identities across services. Long-term benefits include ecosystem enablement, though vigilance regarding token security and fine-grained permissions for agents is necessary.  
2. **API Gateway Pattern:** Provides essential centralized security and management for APIs accessed by users and agents. It offers a good balance of short-term implementation cost (infrastructure setup) versus long-term benefits in security posture, observability, and policy enforcement. It's highly compatible with FIS for handling authentication/authorization and is a key component in securing microservice environments accessed by agents.  
3. **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) Approach:** While representing the highest implementation cost and complexity, ZTA offers the most robust long-term security benefits, especially for complex cloud environments with extensive API usage and autonomous agent interactions. Its principles of continuous verification and least privilege directly address the security challenges posed by agents. It's a strategic investment for organizations prioritizing security and resilience in the face of evolving threats.

These three patterns, often used in combination (e.g., FIS \+ API Gateway within a ZTA framework), represent the most promising directions for building secure, scalable, and future-proof identity and access management systems capable of supporting Agentic AI.

## Consequences

### A. Federated Identity Systems (FIS)

**Supports for API:**

* **Standardized Authorization:** OAuth 2.0 is the de facto standard for delegated API authorization, allowing users to grant specific permissions (scopes) to applications without sharing credentials \[4\], \[8\], \[27\]. OIDC builds on OAuth 2.0 to provide identity information alongside authorization \[4\], \[27\].  
* **Token-Based Access:** Issues tokens (e.g., JWT access tokens, ID tokens) that APIs can validate to authenticate and authorize requests \[4\], \[26\]. APIs rely on these tokens to make access decisions, checking claims like issuer (iss), audience (aud), expiration (exp), and scopes \[4\], \[27\].  
* **Third-Party Integration:** Enables secure integration between different services via APIs by standardizing how authorization is granted and verified across domains, forming the basis of API ecosystems \[18\].  
* **Scope Management:** OAuth scopes provide a mechanism, albeit sometimes coarse-grained, to define the level of access granted to an API client \[8\], \[27\]. Finer-grained control might require extensions like OAuth RAR \[8\] or custom claim validation within the API.

**Pros:**

* Standardized protocols \[1\], \[2\].  
* Scalable user authentication.  
* Centralized User Management.  
* Typically No SP-Stored User Secrets \[1\].  
* **API Context:** Provides standard mechanisms (OAuth 2.0 scopes, OIDC claims) for delegated API authorization and passing user context to APIs \[4\], \[8\], \[27\]. Enables third-party ecosystems via APIs \[18\]. Foundational for securing Agentic AI interactions (e.g., A2A protocol builds on OAuth/OIDC \[30\]).

**Cons:**

* Implementation complexity \[1\].  
* IdP as SPOF/Trust Point \[1\], \[10\].  
* Privacy Concerns (IdP tracking) \[1\].  
* SP Registration Overhead (explicit assoc.) \[1\].  
* Limited User Control (traditional OAuth scopes) \[8\].  
* Vulnerable to future quantum attacks \[16\], \[17\].  
* **API Context:** Managing fine-grained API permissions via scopes can become complex, potentially leading to BFLA (API5) \[27\]; token theft (e.g., leaked access tokens) directly impacts API security (API2) \[27\], \[30\]; potential for misconfigured implementations leading to vulnerabilities \[1\]. May require extensions to handle nuanced delegation for AI agents \[27\].

**Vulnerabilities (non-conclusive):**

* IdP Compromise \[10\].  
* SP Compromise (Session/Token theft).  
* Token Theft/Replay (OAuth Access Tokens, SAML Assertions) \[1\], \[10\].  
* Phishing (IdP credentials) \[1\], \[10\].  
* Pharming/Spoofing (Fake IdP) \[10\].  
* MitM Attacks.  
* XSS/CSRF (at SP/IdP) \[1\].  
* Open Redirects.  
* Implementation Errors (OAuth/OIDC/SAML flaws) \[1\].  
* DoS against IdP \[9\].  
* Quantum Attack (Future) \[16\], \[17\].  
* **API Context:** Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA \- API1:2023), Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA \- API5:2023) if scopes/claims are insufficient or improperly validated by the API; Broken Authentication (API2:2023) via token theft/flaws; Security Misconfiguration (API8:2023) in IdP/SP setup \[20\], \[27\]. Agents with valid tokens can still exploit BOLA/BFLA if API authorization is weak \[27\].

### B. API Gateway

**Supports for API:**

* **Centralized API Authentication/Authorization:** Offloads security validation (e.g., JWT verification, OAuth token introspection, API key validation, scope checking) from individual backend APIs \[13\], \[22\], \[26\]. This enforces consistency.  
* **Security Policy Enforcement:** Enforces security policies like rate limiting, IP whitelisting/blacklisting, and threat detection (e.g., against DoS, injection attacks, malicious bots) uniformly across APIs \[9\], \[18\], \[20\], \[22\], \[26\].  
* **Protocol Translation:** Can translate between different protocols for frontend clients and backend APIs (e.g., REST to gRPC, SOAP to REST) \[18\], \[23\].  
* **API Fa√ßade:** Protects backend services by exposing a controlled interface and hiding internal implementation details and topology \[23\].  
* **Performance Optimization:** Can implement caching, request/response transformation, and load balancing to improve API performance and availability \[23\].  
* **Observability:** Centralizes logging and monitoring for API traffic, aiding in security analysis and debugging \[20\], \[23\].

**Pros:**

* Centralized security enforcement for APIs \[2\], \[6\], \[13\], \[22\], \[26\].  
* Decoupling of security logic from backend APIs.  
* Simplified microservice/API code \[23\].  
* Consistent API security policy application (rate limits, auth) \[18\], \[26\].  
* Protects backend APIs from direct exposure.  
* **API Context:** Improves API manageability, observability \[20\], \[23\], and security posture by consolidating controls \[18\]. Can optimize performance/availability \[23\]. Central point for mitigating OWASP API risks like API2, API4 \[27\]. Suitable for managing access for both human users and AI agents.

**Cons:**

* SPOF/Bottleneck for API traffic \[13\], \[23\].  
* Gateway configuration complexity.  
* Potential for "God Object" anti-pattern.  
* Underlying token mechanisms may be quantum-vulnerable \[17\].  
* **API Context:** Can add latency to API calls \[23\]; gateway itself is a prime target for API attacks (DoS, credential theft, policy bypass, SSRF \- API7, Misconfiguration \- API8) \[27\]. Requires careful performance tuning \[23\]. May not handle fine-grained authorization (API1, API3, API5) effectively without complex logic or integration with external PDPs \[7\]. Needs robust validation to handle potentially malicious requests from compromised agents.

**Vulnerabilities (non-conclusive):**

* Gateway Compromise.  
* Insecure Configuration (Routing, Policies) \[9\].  
* Token Handling Vulnerabilities (JWT flaws, leakage) \[4\].  
* DoS Attacks against Gateway \[9\], \[20\] (API4:2023 \- Unrestricted Resource Consumption if rate limits fail) \[27\].  
* Bypass Vulnerabilities \[2\].  
* Quantum Attack (Future \- against token signatures/TLS) \[17\].  
* **API Context:** Security Misconfiguration (API8:2023) of the gateway; Injection attacks if the gateway doesn't sanitize input passed to backend APIs; Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF \- API7:2023) if gateway can be tricked into calling internal/unintended endpoints; Improper Inventory Management (API9:2023) if gateway exposes undocumented or deprecated APIs \[20\], \[27\]. Excessive Data Exposure (part of API3:2023) if gateway doesn't filter backend responses \[27\]. Agents might exploit gateway misconfigurations or perform DoS.

## C. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) Approach

**Supports for API:**

* **Strict API Authentication:** Every API call must present valid, verified credentials (e.g., tokens from a strong SSO/MFA process). Authentication is not a one-time event but part of continuous verification \[9\].  
* **Granular API Authorization:** Access decisions for each API call are based on verified identity, device posture, context, and specific entitlements (least privilege), often using ABAC principles \[9\], \[14\]. This directly addresses API1, API3, and API5 \[27\].  
* **Continuous Verification:** API sessions or tokens may require periodic re-validation or be subject to continuous evaluation based on risk signals (CAEP \[15\]), enhancing resilience against token theft (API2) \[27\].  
* **Micro-segmentation for APIs:** Network policies restrict which services can call which APIs, limiting the blast radius of a compromised service or exploited API vulnerability.  
* **API Monitoring & Threat Detection:** API traffic is continuously monitored for anomalies and threats using techniques like ML, crucial for detecting sophisticated attacks or abuse of business flows (API6) \[20\], \[22\], \[27\].

**Pros:**

* Significantly improved security posture against modern threats, including sophisticated API attacks \[9\].  
* Reduced lateral movement via API compromises.  
* Granular, context-aware API access control \[9\].  
* Better visibility into API access patterns.  
* Supports distributed/cloud API environments.  
* **API Context:** Explicitly designed to secure API interactions in complex, perimeter-less environments. Addresses multiple OWASP API risks through continuous verification and least privilege \[27\]. Highly relevant for securing interactions involving potentially untrusted AI agents.

**Cons:**

* High implementation complexity and cost for API infrastructure.  
* Potential negative impact on API performance/latency due to continuous verification.  
* Requires mature security tooling (identity, API security gateways, monitoring) \[9\], \[20\].  
* Significant organizational/cultural shift.  
* Interoperability challenges.  
* Effectiveness depends on quantum-resistance of underlying crypto.  
* **API Context:** Requires careful policy definition and continuous monitoring to avoid disrupting legitimate API traffic while blocking threats. Tuning continuous verification for agent interactions (which may differ from human patterns) can be challenging.

**Vulnerabilities (non-conclusive):**

* Policy Misconfiguration \[14\].  
* Compromise of Core Components (PDP, PEP, IdP, Monitoring).  
* Identity Provider Compromise.  
* Insider Threats.  
* API Security Gaps between ZTA components.  
* Complexity-Induced Gaps.  
* Monitoring/Logging Evasion or Failure \[20\].  
* Device Health Check Bypass.  
* Quantum Attack (Future \- against crypto components).  
* **API Context:** Overly complex authorization policies can lead to errors (API1, API3, API5 flaws) \[27\]; performance overhead might tempt developers to bypass checks; requires robust monitoring to detect sophisticated API attacks \[22\]; Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows (API6:2023) if policies don't properly model and restrict sequences of API calls \[20\], \[27\]. Unsafe Consumption of APIs (API10:2023) if trust is implicitly granted based on ZTA principles without validating consumed data, especially relevant for agents consuming tool outputs \[27\], \[31\].
