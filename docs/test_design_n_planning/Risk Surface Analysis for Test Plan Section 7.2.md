# **Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.2: Functional and Validation Testing**

This document outlines the potential risk surfaces of the GSAi API Framework relevant to the functional and validation testing strategies detailed in Section 7.2 of the TestPlan.md. The analysis focuses on how these functional aspects and validation mechanisms interact with AI/LLM use cases and where functional issues or vulnerabilities might arise.  

The goal is to identify areas requiring rigorous functional testing to ensure the API behaves correctly, reliably, and as specified, especially when interacting with LLMs.

## **Specification-Driven Testing**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Adherence to API Specifications (docs/adr/001\_Open\_AI\_API.md, OpenAPI schema at /openapi.json)  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (Main), 5.1 (Core API Functionality)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Ensuring the API's behavior, request/response schemas, and parameters for chat, embeddings, and model listing align with the documented specifications, which are based on OpenAI standards. Deviations can lead to integration issues for clients expecting OpenAI-compatible behavior.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: API requests structured according to documented schemas (e.g., ChatCompletionRequest).  
  * Processing: API logic, provider adapters, LLM interaction.  
  * Output: API responses structured according to documented schemas (e.g., ChatCompletionResponse).  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * Incompatibility with client libraries designed for OpenAI's API if schemas (fields, types, optionality) diverge.  
  * Misinterpretation of parameters (e.g., temperature, max\_tokens, stream) if not handled as per spec, leading to unexpected LLM behavior or errors.  
  * Incorrect usage data (token counts) if calculation deviates from spec.  
  * finish\_reason not matching specified enum values.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py: Defines request/response Pydantic models.  
  * app/routers/api\_v1.py: Implements endpoints using these schemas.  
  * app/main.py: FastAPI generates /openapi.json based on these Pydantic models and route definitions.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** The API behaves as a compliant OpenAI-compatible interface for chat and embeddings, ensuring predictable integration and LLM interaction for clients.  
* **Cross-references:** TestPlan.md Section 5.13.2 (Provider Contract Adherence).

## **Input Validation**

This is a broad area. We'll break it down by the types of validation mentioned in the Test Plan. The core risk is that improperly validated input can lead to errors, unexpected behavior in the API framework, or incorrect requests being sent to the downstream LLM providers.

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Request Parameter & Body Validation (Pydantic Schemas)  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (Input Validation), 5.4.1 (Standard Input Validation)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Validating the structure, types, and constraints of all inputs to /chat/completions, /embeddings, and /models (though /models is GET with no body). This includes model IDs, messages, roles, content parts, temperature, max\_tokens, streaming flags, embedding inputs, etc.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: User-submitted JSON payloads and query parameters.  
  * Processing: FastAPI uses Pydantic models (app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py) for parsing and validation. Custom validation like parse\_data\_uri in app/providers/utils.py.  
  * Output: Validated data passed to service logic, or 4xx error if validation fails.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Standard Parameters:**  
    * Incorrect model ID format/type leading to routing errors or provider errors.  
    * Malformed messages array (e.g., wrong roles, missing content) causing LLM to misunderstand context or fail.  
    * Invalid temperature, top\_p, max\_tokens values passed to LLM, resulting in suboptimal or erroneous generation.  
    * Invalid stream boolean leading to wrong response mode.  
    * For embeddings: invalid input type (not string or list of strings), incorrect dimensions.  
  * **Boundary Testing:**  
    * Empty messages array (if not allowed) or messages with empty content.  
    * max\_tokens at 0, 1, or a very large value â€“ how does the API/LLM handle it?  
    * temperature at 0 or 2\.  
    * input for embeddings being an empty string or an extremely long string/list.  
  * **Type Validation:**  
    * String field receiving an integer, float field receiving a string, etc. Pydantic should catch these, but the error reporting needs to be clear.  
  * **Schema Evolution (Forward Compatibility):**  
    * If clients send extra, unknown fields in the request body, FastAPI/Pydantic typically ignores them by default. This is generally desired for forward compatibility. Risk is low unless the extra fields coincidentally match internal variable names and cause issues (unlikely with Pydantic).  
  * **Parameterized Test Cases:** Ensuring a wide range of valid and invalid inputs for each parameter combination is crucial.  
  * **Fuzz Testing:** Random inputs could uncover unexpected Pydantic parser issues or edge cases in custom validators (e.g., parse\_data\_uri).  
  * **Multi-Modal File Validation Risks:**
    * **File Name Injection:** Malicious file names containing path traversal sequences (../../../etc/passwd), special characters, or encoding exploits could be passed through to provider adapters without proper sanitization.
    * **File Content Validation Gaps:** Insufficient validation of MIME types, Base64 encoding integrity, or file content structure could allow malicious files to reach LLM providers.
    * **Provider-Specific File Handling:** Differences between Bedrock adapter (defaulting to "Untitled") and OpenAI adapter (passing file_name) could create inconsistent security postures or unexpected behavior.
    * **File Metadata Exposure:** File names or metadata could inadvertently expose sensitive information about user systems or data sources.
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py: Contains all Pydantic models with type hints and validators (e.g., confloat, Literal, Base64Bytes).  
  * app/providers/utils.py: parse\_data\_uri for image data URI validation.  
  * app/routers/api\_v1.py: Endpoints use these schemas, FastAPI handles 422 errors for Pydantic failures. Custom InputDataError (400) for parse\_data\_uri failures.
  * app/providers/core/chat_schema.py: FilePart schema with optional name field for document naming.
  * app/providers/bedrock/adapter_from_core.py: File name handling with "Untitled" default.
  * app/providers/open_ai/adapter_to_core.py: File name propagation through file_name parameter.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** The API robustly validates all inputs according to the defined schemas and constraints. Invalid inputs are rejected with clear 4xx errors. Valid inputs are correctly parsed and passed to the LLM interaction logic. This prevents malformed requests from reaching LLMs or causing internal API errors.  
* **Cross-references:** 7\_3\_InputValidation\_InjectionTesting.md (focuses on security implications of input validation); TestPlan.md Section 4.2 (Input and Output Validation Risks).

## **Response Validation**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** API Response Structure & Content Validation  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (Response Validation), 5.5 (Output Encoding & Data Handling)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Ensuring that responses from /chat/completions, /embeddings, and /models adhere to their defined schemas, including correct HTTP status codes, headers, and payload structures. This is vital for client applications that parse these responses.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: Internal data from LLM provider (after adapter transformation) or from API logic (e.g., model list).  
  * Processing: FastAPI serializes Pydantic response models (app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py) into JSON.  
  * Output: HTTP response to the client.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Success Responses (200 OK):**  
    * /models: List does not match LLMModel schema (name, id, capability).  
    * /chat/completions: Response deviates from ChatCompletionResponse (e.g., missing choices, incorrect message structure, wrong role, missing/incorrect usage data).  
    * /embeddings: Response deviates from EmbeddingResponse (e.g., incorrect data structure, missing embedding vector, wrong model ID).  
  * **Error Responses:**  
    * Incorrect HTTP status codes for specific error types (e.g., sending 500 for a client-side validation issue).
    * **Enhanced ValidationError Handling:** With the new global ValidationError exception handler (app/main.py), there's risk of exposing too much validation detail or internal system information in error responses.
    * **Provider-Specific Error Propagation:** Inconsistent error handling between different LLM providers could expose provider-specific details or create confusing error patterns for clients.
    * Error payload not matching a standard error schema (e.g., {"detail": "..."} or {"error": {"message": "..."}}).  
  * **Streaming Responses (/chat/completions with stream: true):**  
    * Server-Sent Events (SSE) format incorrect (e.g., wrong event types, malformed data lines).  
    * Chunks not adhering to ChatCompletionChunk schema.  
    * Final \[DONE\] message missing or incorrect.  
  * **Usage Metrics (usage object in chat/embeddings):**  
    * Incorrect prompt\_tokens, completion\_tokens, or total\_tokens. This directly impacts billing and client-side tracking.  
  * **Response Content Testing (Basic Semantic Checks):**  
    * model ID in response should match the requested model.  
    * role in chat response should typically be assistant.  
    * Embedding vectors should be lists of floats.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py: Defines response models (ChatCompletionResponse, EmbeddingResponse, LLMModel, ChatCompletionChunk).  
  * app/routers/api\_v1.py: Endpoints use response\_model attribute, ensuring FastAPI validates outgoing data against these schemas.  
  * Adapter modules (app/providers/\*/adapter\_to\_core.py) are responsible for transforming provider responses into these core schemas. Errors here could lead to response validation failures.  
  * Streaming logic in provider backends (e.g., app/providers/bedrock/bedrock.py) and adapter to core for streaming.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** All API responses strictly adhere to their documented schemas and use correct HTTP status codes. Streaming responses follow SSE standards. Usage metrics are accurate. This ensures clients can reliably parse and use API outputs.  
* **Cross-references:** 7\_3\_DataExposure.md (Section 2.A, 2.B for data exposure risks in responses).

## **Business Logic Validation**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Internal API Logic and Provider Interaction  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (Business Logic Validation), 5.3 (Provider Integration), app/providers/dependencies.py  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Testing the correctness of internal decision-making processes, such as routing requests to the correct LLM provider based on the model ID, ensuring model capabilities match the endpoint, and handling provider failover if implemented.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: Validated API request (e.g., ChatCompletionRequest with a specific model ID).  
  * Processing:  
    * app/providers/dependencies.py: get\_model\_config\_validated resolves model ID to provider configuration from settings.backend\_map. Checks capability.  
    * Provider-specific backend (e.g., BedRockBackend, VertexBackend) is invoked.  
    * Adapter modules (adapter\_from\_core.py, adapter\_to\_core.py) translate schemas.  
  * Output: Request sent to the correct downstream LLM; response from LLM processed.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Model Routing:**  
    * Request for claude\_3\_5\_sonnet (Bedrock) being incorrectly routed to Vertex AI, or vice-versa.  
    * Non-existent model ID in settings.backend\_map not handled gracefully (should be caught by get\_model\_config\_validated).  
  * **Capability Matching:**  
    * Attempting to use a chat model (e.g., gemini-2.0-flash) with the /embeddings endpoint, or an embedding model (e.g., cohere\_english\_v3) with /chat/completions. get\_model\_config\_validated should prevent this.  
  * **Fallback Logic (if implemented):**  
    * If a primary provider fails, the API doesn't switch to a configured backup provider correctly.  
    * State or context lost during failover.  
  * **Rate Limiting (Functional aspect):**  
    * If the API implements its own rate limiting logic (beyond provider limits), ensuring it correctly tracks usage and applies limits per API key/agency. (Test Plan Section 5.9.6)  
  * **Model-Provider Mapping Verification:**  
    * Configuration in settings.backend\_map being incorrect (e.g., wrong ARN, project ID, or model name for the provider).  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/config/settings.py: backend\_map defines model-to-provider mappings.  
  * app/providers/dependencies.py: get\_model\_config\_validated is the core logic for model validation, routing, and capability checking.  
  * app/providers/base.py: BaseLLMProvider and specific implementations (BedRockBackend, VertexBackend).  
  * Adapter modules in app/providers/{bedrock|vertex\_ai|open\_ai}/.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** Requests are routed to the correct LLM provider and model based on validated input. Capability checks prevent misuse of models. Provider-specific request/response formats are handled correctly by adapters. Any failover logic operates seamlessly.  
* **Cross-references:** TestPlan.md Section 5.3 (Provider Integration), 7.5.2 (Provider Failover Testing).

## **Pre-runtime Protection Verification**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** OpenAPI Schema Conformance  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (Pre-runtime Protection Verification)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Ensuring the live API's behavior (endpoints, request/response structures, parameters) matches the statically defined OpenAPI specification (/openapi.json). This is a form of contract testing against the API's own advertised interface.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: The /openapi.json file generated by FastAPI.  
  * Processing: Automated tools (e.g., Schemathesis, Tavern) make requests to the live API based on the schema and validate responses against it.  
  * Output: Report of discrepancies between specified and actual behavior.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * An endpoint parameter (e.g., max\_tokens for chat) is defined in OpenAPI spec but not actually implemented or used by the backend logic when calling the LLM.  
  * A response field (e.g., usage.completion\_tokens) is present in the OpenAPI spec but is missing or has the wrong type in actual API responses.  
  * Enum values for fields like role or finish\_reason in the spec don't match the values the API actually accepts/returns.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * FastAPI automatically generates /openapi.json from Pydantic models and route decorators in app/routers/api\_v1.py and app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py. The risk is that the Python code (e.g., adapter logic, provider interaction) might not perfectly honor every detail implied by the Pydantic models when it comes to actual LLM interaction.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** The live API behavior is fully consistent with its OpenAPI specification, ensuring that clients building against the spec will not encounter unexpected functional issues related to LLM interactions.  
* **Cross-references:** TestPlan.md Section 5.13 (API Versioning & Contract Adherence), 5.14 (Documentation Accuracy).

## **LLM-Specific Functional Testing**

These risk surfaces are about the unique functional behaviors of LLMs.

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Token Limit Handling  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (LLM-Specific Functional Testing \- Token Limit Handling), 5.9.5 (Context Window Handling)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** How the API and downstream LLMs handle requests that approach or exceed token limits (context window size, max\_tokens for generation).  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: Prompts of varying lengths; max\_tokens parameter.  
  * Processing: The API framework might do some preliminary checks, but primarily the LLM provider enforces its own context window limits and uses max\_tokens. The API framework needs to correctly relay these parameters and handle provider responses/errors.  
  * Output: Successful response (possibly truncated if max\_tokens is hit), or an error if context window is exceeded by the prompt. Accurate token counts in usage.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * API or LLM crashes/errors ungracefully if prompt exceeds context window, instead of returning a clear error.  
  * max\_tokens parameter not respected, leading to longer-than-requested (and more expensive) generations, or ignored leading to default (potentially short) generation.  
  * Incorrect token counting for prompts/completions, especially with multi-modal inputs, special tokens, or different languages.  
  * Inconsistent behavior across different models/providers regarding token limits and truncation.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py: max\_tokens is an optional parameter.  
  * Adapter logic in app/providers/\*/adapter\_from\_core.py passes these parameters to provider SDKs.  
  * Provider SDKs and backend LLMs handle the actual enforcement. The API framework needs to correctly interpret their responses/errors.  
  * Token counting is typically returned by the provider and included in the response by adapter\_to\_core.py.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** The API and LLMs handle token limits gracefully. Prompts exceeding context windows result in clear errors. max\_tokens is respected. Token counts in usage are accurate.  
* **Cross-references:** TestPlan.md Section 4.3 (Unrestricted Resource Consumption \- related to cost).  
* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Streaming Response Validation (Functional)  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (LLM-Specific Functional Testing \- Streaming Response Validation), 5.1.2 (Chat Completions \- Streaming), 7.5.3 (Streaming Response Reliability)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Correctness of the Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream for /chat/completions when stream: true. This includes chunk format, event types, data content, and stream termination.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: ChatCompletionRequest with stream: true.  
  * Processing: Provider backend (e.g., BedRockBackend) yields chunks from the LLM provider's streaming response. Adapter (adapter\_to\_core.py) transforms these into ChatCompletionChunk objects, which are then formatted as SSE by FastAPI.  
  * Output: An HTTP response with Content-Type: text/event-stream, containing a sequence of SSE events.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * Incorrect SSE formatting (e.g., missing data:, wrong event names, incorrect line endings).  
  * Individual chunks not conforming to ChatCompletionChunk schema (e.g., choices\[\].delta.content issues, incorrect finish\_reason in the final relevant chunk).  
  * Stream terminating prematurely or not terminating with \[DONE\].  
  * Order of chunks being incorrect.  
  * Token usage information in the final non-data chunk (if supported by provider and schema) being inaccurate or missing.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * Provider backends (e.g., app/providers/bedrock/bedrock.py chat\_stream method) handle interaction with provider SDK streaming.  
  * app/providers/open\_ai/adapter\_to\_core.py: core\_chat\_chunk\_to\_openai transforms internal chunks to ChatCompletionChunk.  
  * FastAPI handles the SSE formatting when an endpoint returns a generator.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** Streaming responses are well-formed SSE events, with each data chunk adhering to the ChatCompletionChunk schema. The stream terminates correctly, allowing clients to reliably reconstruct the full completion.  
* **Cross-references:** Test Plan Section 7.4.1 (TTFT, Token Generation Throughput for performance aspects of streaming).  
* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Model-Specific Behavior Validation  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (LLM-Specific Functional Testing \- Model-Specific Behavior)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Verifying that parameters like temperature, top\_p, presence\_penalty, frequency\_penalty, and stop sequences function as expected for different models and providers. Also, system message handling.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: ChatCompletionRequest with various model-specific parameters set.  
  * Processing: These parameters are passed through adapters to the respective LLM providers. The LLMs interpret these parameters to modify generation behavior.  
  * Output: LLM completion whose characteristics (randomness, repetitiveness, stopping points) are influenced by the input parameters.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * temperature: Setting to 0 not producing (near-)deterministic output, or high values not increasing randomness.  
  * top\_p: Not correctly influencing token selection.  
  * presence\_penalty, frequency\_penalty: Not having the expected effect on token repetition.  
  * stop sequences: LLM not stopping generation when a stop sequence is encountered, or stopping prematurely.  
  * System messages (role: "system") not being correctly interpreted by the model to set context/behavior.  
  * Inconsistent behavior of these parameters across different models or providers (e.g., a temperature of 0.7 might behave differently for Claude vs. Gemini).  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py: Defines these optional parameters.  
  * Adapter logic in app/providers/\*/adapter\_from\_core.py must correctly map these to the provider-specific SDK calls. Some providers might not support all OpenAI parameters, or might have different names/scales.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** Model-specific parameters correctly influence LLM generation as per their definitions. System messages are effective. While exact output is non-deterministic (for temp \> 0), the *effect* of parameters should be observable and consistent with documentation.  
* **Cross-references:** Test Plan Section 5.1.2 (Correct handling of all request schema parameters).

## **Multi-Provider Validation**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Request Translation & Response Normalization (Adapters)  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (Multi-Provider Validation)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Ensuring that the adapter layers (app/providers/{bedrock|vertex\_ai}/adapter\_\*.py) correctly translate requests from the API's core OpenAI-like schema to the specific format required by each downstream provider (Bedrock, Vertex AI) and then normalize their diverse responses back into the core schema.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: Core schema request (e.g., InternalChatRequest).  
  * Processing:  
    * adapter\_from\_core.py (per provider): Converts core request to provider-specific request.  
    * LLM Provider interaction.  
    * adapter\_to\_core.py (per provider): Converts provider-specific response to core response (e.g., InternalChatResponse).  
  * Output: Core schema response, which is then given to app.providers.open\_ai.adapter\_from\_core to produce the final OpenAI-compatible response.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Request Translation:**  
    * Message roles (system, user, assistant) mapped incorrectly for a provider.  
    * Multi-modal content (images, files) not formatted correctly for the provider.  
    * Parameters like temperature, max\_tokens misinterpreted or dropped if provider uses different names/scales and mapping is flawed.  
    * Tool use/function calling parameters not translated correctly.  
  * **Response Normalization:**  
    * finish\_reason from provider not mapped to a standard OpenAI-compatible reason.  
    * Token counts (prompt\_tokens, completion\_tokens) extracted or calculated incorrectly from provider response.  
    * Content (text, tool calls) from provider response not correctly placed into the core schema.  
    * Error codes/messages from provider not translated into meaningful and standardized API errors.  
  * **Feature Parity:**  
    * Attempting to use a feature (e.g., a specific stop sequence format, a very high max\_tokens) with a provider that doesn't support it, and the adapter doesn't handle this gracefully (e.g., by raising an appropriate error or adjusting the request).  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/providers/bedrock/adapter\_from\_core.py and adapter\_to\_core.py.  
  * app/providers/vertex\_ai/adapter\_from\_core.py and adapter\_to\_core.py.  
  * These files contain the detailed logic for mapping fields, roles, parameters, and response structures.  
  * Provider-specific schemas (e.g., app/providers/bedrock/converse\_schemas.py) define what the adapters work with.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** Adapters accurately and robustly translate requests and normalize responses, ensuring consistent API behavior regardless of the underlying LLM provider. Unsupported features are handled gracefully. This is key to the API's role as an abstraction layer.  
* **Cross-references:** Test Plan Section 5.3.1 (Multi-Provider Interaction).

## **Agency-Specific Functional Testing (Simulated)**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** API Key Scoping and Usage Tracking (Functional)  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (Agency-Specific Functional Testing)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Verifying that API keys correctly limit access to permitted models/operations and that usage (token counts, requests) is accurately attributed to the correct agency/API key for billing and quota enforcement.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: API request with an Authorization header containing an API key.  
  * Processing:  
    * app/auth/dependencies.py: get\_current\_active\_user\_with\_api\_key retrieves key details, including scopes and manager\_id. requires\_scope enforces endpoint access.  
    * app/providers/dependencies.py: get\_model\_config\_validated might incorporate agency-specific model permissions in the future (not explicitly shown now, but a potential area).  
    * app/services/billing.py: billing\_worker receives usage data associated with api\_key.id and api\_key.manager\_id.  
  * Output: Access granted/denied based on scope. Usage data logged for billing.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **API Key Scoping:**  
    * An API key with only models:embedding scope incorrectly allowed to call /chat/completions.  
    * An API key restricted to certain models (if such a feature is added) still able to use other models.  
    * models:read scope incorrectly allowing /chat/completions or /embeddings access.  
    * models:embedding scope allowing access to chat models or vice versa.  
  * **Usage Tracking:**  
    * Token counts from an LLM interaction attributed to the wrong API key or manager\_id.  
    * Requests not logged for billing, or logged with incorrect details.  
    * Token counting errors for multi-modal inputs (images, files) leading to incorrect billing.  
    * Streaming requests not properly attributed if connection fails mid-stream.  
  * **Quota Enforcement (Functional):**  
    * If quotas are implemented (per key/agency), they are not correctly enforced (e.g., allowing more requests/tokens than permitted).  
    * Quota checks not considering pending/in-flight requests, allowing overuse.  
    * Incorrect quota calculations leading to premature cutoffs or unlimited usage.  
  * **User Management Integration:**  
    * User creation/deletion not properly updating API key associations, leading to orphaned keys with LLM access.  
    * User role changes not reflected in API key scopes, allowing inappropriate model access.  
  * **API Key Lifecycle:**  
    * Key rotation not properly invalidating old keys, leading to unauthorized LLM usage.  
    * Key expiration not enforced, allowing continued LLM access beyond intended timeframe.  
  * **Multi-Tenant Isolation:**  
    * Concurrent requests causing cross-contamination of agency contexts.  
    * Cache pollution between agencies affecting LLM model selection or configuration.  
    * Provider connection pooling mixing agency requests or credentials.  
    * Billing records incorrectly attributed to wrong agencies during high concurrency.  
    * Session state bleeding between agency requests in streaming scenarios.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/auth/schemas.py: Defines APIScope.  
  * app/auth/dependencies.py: requires\_scope and get\_current\_active\_user\_with\_api\_key.  
  * app/auth/models.py: APIKey model stores scopes and manager\_id.  
  * app/auth/repositories.py: Database operations for API keys and permissions.  
  * app/auth/utils.py: Auth utility functions and token handling.  
  * app/users/models.py, app/users/repositories.py, app/users/schemas.py: Complete user management system.  
  * app/services/billing.py: Logic for queuing billing data and quota enforcement.  
  * app/routers/api\_v1.py: Collects usage data and sends to billing queue.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** API key scopes are correctly enforced for all LLM operations. All LLM usage is accurately tracked and attributed for billing and quota management.

## **Edge Case Testing**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Handling of Atypical Inputs and Scenarios  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (Edge Case Testing)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Testing how the API and downstream LLMs respond to unusual but potentially valid inputs, or high-concurrency situations.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: Various edge case inputs (empty strings/lists, special characters, large payloads, malformed JSON parts not caught by Pydantic top-level parsing but by deeper logic).  
  * Processing: API logic, adapters, LLM provider.  
  * Output: API response (successful or error).  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Empty Inputs:**  
    * Empty string in messages\[\].content or EmbeddingRequest.input. How does the LLM handle it? Does the API error out or pass it through?  
    * Empty list for messages (if Pydantic min\_length allows, or if it's bypassed).  
  * **Unicode and Special Characters:**  
    * Emojis, right-to-left text, control characters in prompts. Do they break adapter logic, provider SDKs, or confuse the LLM? Are they counted correctly for tokens?  
    * Right-to-left (RTL) text causing adapter or provider parsing errors.  
    * Emoji and special unicode characters affecting token counting accuracy.  
    * Control characters breaking streaming response format or SSE parsing.  
  * **Large Payloads:**  
    * Very long prompts (approaching context window limits).  
    * Very large number of messages in a chat request.  
    * Very large batch of texts for embeddings.  
    * Does the API framework (e.g., Uvicorn, FastAPI) handle these gracefully before they even hit Pydantic, or do they cause memory issues/crashes?  
    * Requests approaching FastAPI/Uvicorn size limits causing timeouts or memory issues.  
    * Large batch embedding requests exceeding provider limits.  
  * **Concurrent Requests:**  
    * Multiple simultaneous requests from the same API key. Does this lead to rate-limiting issues (if any are self-imposed by API), errors, or incorrect billing if state is mishandled?  
    * Same API key making simultaneous requests causing auth cache invalidation.  
    * Provider rate limiting affecting concurrent requests from same agency.  
    * Database connection exhaustion during high concurrency testing.  
  * **Malformed JSON (subtly):**  
    * JSON that is structurally valid but semantically incorrect in a way Pydantic might miss if not constrained enough (e.g., a list where a dict is expected in a less-typed part of a schema, though Pydantic is usually good here).  
    * Nested JSON structures that pass Pydantic validation but break adapter logic.  
    * Mixed data types in arrays that providers can't handle.  
    * Missing required fields that pass top-level validation but fail deeper processing.  
  * **Network & Connection Edge Cases:**  
    * Client disconnections during streaming responses.  
    * Provider timeouts during long-running LLM operations.  
    * Partial request data causing parsing errors.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * Relies on Pydantic for most structural validation.  
  * Adapters and provider SDKs handle the content passed to LLMs.  
  * Web server (Uvicorn) has its own limits for request size.  
  * app/main.py: FastAPI configuration affecting request size and timeout limits.  
  * All Pydantic schemas: Input validation boundary conditions.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** The API handles edge cases gracefully, either by processing them correctly if valid (even if unusual), or by returning clear and appropriate error messages if invalid. No crashes or unexpected behavior. LLM interactions remain stable.

## **Response Quality Assessment (Basic Functional Checks)**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Basic LLM Output Plausibility  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.2 (Response Quality Assessment)  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Automated checks for very basic aspects of LLM response quality, not deep semantic understanding, but functional correctness.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: LLM-generated content within API responses.  
  * Processing: Test automation would parse the response and apply simple checks.  
  * Output: Pass/fail for these basic quality checks.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Functional Issues/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Basic Response Evaluation:** LLM consistently returns empty content, "I don't know" inappropriately, or completely irrelevant gibberish for simple, well-defined prompts.  
  * **Output Variation Analysis (Functional):** temperature=0 not yielding identical/near-identical responses for the same prompt (functional check of determinism).  
  * **Format Adherence (Simple):** If a prompt asks for a list and the LLM returns a paragraph, or vice-versa (for very simple, constrained cases).  
  * **Regression Detection (Functional):** A previously working simple prompt for a specific model suddenly starts failing or returning vastly different (and incorrect) structural output.  
  * **Automated Quality Metrics:**  
    * Response length variation detection for consistency across providers.  
    * Format adherence checking for structured output requests.  
    * Relevance scoring for basic prompt-response alignment.  
  * **Cross-Provider Consistency:**  
    * Quality metric comparison across Bedrock, Vertex AI, and OpenAI providers.  
    * Feature parity validation for supported parameters across providers.  
    * Error handling consistency across different provider failure modes.  
  * **Determinism Validation:**  
    * Temperature=0 consistency checking across multiple requests.  
    * Seed parameter effectiveness for reproducible outputs (where supported).  
    * Provider-specific determinism behavior validation.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * This is primarily a testing strategy concern. The API itself just relays LLM output. The risk is that changes in provider models or adapter logic could lead to functionally broken responses.  
* **Expected Secure/Correct Functional Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** LLM responses are structurally sound and meet very basic expectations of relevance and format for test prompts. The API faithfully transmits these responses.  
* **Cross-references:** Test Plan Section 5.5.2 (LLM Response Validation \- broader scope). This section (7.2) focuses on *automated* basic checks.
