# **Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.12: Zero Trust Testing Strategy**

## **0\. Introduction**

This document outlines the potential risk surfaces of the GSAi API Framework relevant to the Zero Trust testing strategies detailed in Section 7.12 of the TestPlan.md. The analysis focuses on how various components and processes align with Zero Trust principles—specifically, "never trust, always verify" for every interaction—especially when proxying requests to AI/LLM providers.  

Zero Trust is not a single product but a security model and an associated set of practices. For this API, it means rigorously verifying identity, controlling access, monitoring activity, and ensuring data security at every step of an API request involving LLMs.

The goal is to identify areas where the implementation of Zero Trust principles needs to be validated to ensure the security and integrity of LLM interactions.

## **Authentication & Authorization**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** API Key Authentication and Scope-Based Authorization Mechanisms  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Authentication & Authorization)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Authentication Implementation:** app/auth/dependencies.py:16-45 valid\_api\_key function using HTTPBearer for API key extraction and validation  
    * **Authorization Framework:** app/auth/dependencies.py:48-66 RequiresScope class implementing scope-based authorization with set-based permission checking  
    * **Key Storage Model:** app/auth/models.py:12-32 APIKey model with hashed\_key storage, scopes array, expiration, and activity tracking  
    * **Cryptographic Utilities:** app/auth/utils.py:4-24 secure key generation using secrets.token\_urlsafe and SHA256 hashing with constant-time comparison  
    * **Scope Definitions:** app/auth/schemas.py:10-20 comprehensive scope enumeration including MODELS\_INFERENCE, MODELS\_EMBEDDING, ADMIN  
    * **Endpoint Protection:** All LLM endpoints in app/routers/api\_v1.py:33-70 protected with RequiresScope dependencies  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:  
    Every API request to LLM functionalities (/chat/completions, /embeddings, /models) must be authenticated (verifying the API key) and authorized (checking if the key has the required scope for the operation). This aligns with Zero Trust's principle of verifying every request.  
  * **Potential Risks from a Zero Trust Perspective:**  
    * **Authentication Bypass:** Any flaw allowing an unauthenticated request to reach LLM processing logic.  
    * **Weak API Key Management:** Insufficient key entropy, insecure storage (even if hashed, consider algorithm strength/salt), or improper lifecycle management (creation, revocation, expiry) could lead to compromised identities.  
    * **Scope Escalation/Bypass:** Flaws in requires\_scope logic or incorrect scope assignment allowing an API key to access LLM functionalities or models it shouldn't.  
    * **Implicit Trust after Initial Auth:** Once authenticated, assuming the entity is trustworthy for all subsequent internal operations without further checks (though current design seems per-request).  
    * **Insufficient Context in Auth Decisions:** Authentication/authorization decisions not considering enough context (e.g., source IP, time of day, unusual request patterns, if such policies were desired under ZT).  
  * **Current Implementation Analysis:**  
    * **Strong Authentication:** app/auth/dependencies.py:25-44 implements comprehensive API key validation including expiration checks and active status verification  
    * **Robust Cryptography:** app/auth/utils.py:4-14 uses cryptographically secure random generation (32 bytes default) and SHA256 hashing  
    * **Granular Authorization:** app/auth/dependencies.py:57-65 enforces scope-based permissions with set operations for precise privilege checking  
    * **Request Context Tracking:** app/logs/middleware.py:38-39 binds API key ID to request context for comprehensive audit trails  
    * **Zero Trust Gaps:** Missing dynamic context evaluation, no IP-based restrictions, and static scope-based decisions without adaptive trust  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** Every API call is explicitly authenticated and authorized before any interaction with LLM services or sensitive data. Authentication is robust, and authorization is granular and strictly enforced based on verified identity and context.

## **Least Privilege**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Enforcement of Minimal Necessary Permissions for API Keys and Internal Components  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Least Privilege)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Scope Definition Framework:** app/auth/schemas.py:10-20 defines granular scopes with clear separation between inference, embedding, and administrative functions  
    * **Privilege Enforcement:** app/auth/dependencies.py:48-66 RequiresScope implementation with strict subset checking for minimal privilege validation  
    * **Administrative Key Creation:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py:19-49 creates admin users with comprehensive scope assignment but potentially overly broad permissions  
    * **Provider Access Control:** Backend configuration through app/config/settings.py:11-21 maps models to providers with implicit privilege assumptions  
    * **Database Permission Model:** app/auth/models.py:18 implements scopes as PostgreSQL array for flexible permission storage  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:  
    API keys should only have the scopes necessary for their intended LLM interactions (e.g., an inference key shouldn't manage other keys). The API application itself should also operate with the least privilege needed to call downstream LLM providers.  
  * **Potential Risks from a Zero Trust Perspective:**  
    * **Overly Broad API Key Scopes:** Defaulting to permissive scopes or assigning unnecessary scopes to API keys, allowing wider access to LLM functionalities than required.  
    * **Privileged Internal Components:** If any internal service or function within the API framework runs with more privileges than necessary when interacting with LLM provider SDKs or other internal resources.  
    * **Excessive Permissions for LLM Provider Access:** The IAM roles used by the API to call Bedrock/Vertex AI might grant permissions beyond model invocation (e.g., permissions to list/modify other cloud resources).  
    * **Failure to Revoke/Reduce Privileges:** Not promptly revoking or reducing scopes when an API key's purpose changes or it's no longer needed.  
  * **Current Implementation Analysis:**  
    * **Granular Scope Design:** app/auth/schemas.py:10-20 provides fine-grained permissions separating inference from embedding and administrative functions  
    * **Strict Enforcement:** app/auth/dependencies.py:60-65 uses set operations to ensure exact scope matching without privilege escalation  
    * **Administrative Scope Concerns:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py:19 assigns broad ADMIN scope that may violate least privilege principles  
    * **Missing Dynamic Privilege Adjustment:** No runtime privilege reduction or context-based permission narrowing  
    * **Provider Access Gaps:** Backend initialization lacks explicit privilege validation for LLM provider access  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** API keys and internal application components operate with the minimum necessary permissions to perform their intended LLM-related tasks. Access to LLM models and functionalities is strictly limited by verified scopes.

## **Network Segmentation (Micro-segmentation)**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Network Controls and Isolation of API Components  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Network Segmentation)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Container Networking:** docker-compose.yml:37-38 defines basic backend network isolation between API and database services  
    * **Service Communication:** docker-compose.yml:12-20 exposes API on port 8080 with network aliases for service discovery  
    * **Database Isolation:** docker-compose.yml:22-35 isolates PostgreSQL database in backend network with explicit service dependencies  
    * **Missing Security Policies:** No network security policies, traffic filtering, or micro-segmentation controls in container configuration  
    * **Provider Communication:** LLM provider connections via internet without explicit network controls or traffic inspection  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:  
    In a Zero Trust Architecture, network traffic is controlled between components (microservices, database, API gateway, LLM providers). The API should only be ableable to communicate with explicitly authorized downstream LLM provider endpoints and its own database.  
  * **Potential Risks from a Zero Trust Perspective:**  
    * **Flat Network:** Lack of segmentation allowing a compromised API instance to potentially access other internal services or resources it shouldn't.  
    * **Overly Permissive Egress Rules:** API instances allowed to make outbound connections to arbitrary internet locations, rather than just whitelisted LLM provider endpoints. This could be exploited for data exfiltration if the API is compromised and used to proxy malicious requests.  
    * **Insufficient Ingress Controls:** API endpoints exposed more broadly than necessary, or internal management interfaces accessible from untrusted networks.  
    * **Lateral Movement:** If an attacker gains access to one part of the API infrastructure, lack of internal segmentation could allow them to move to other parts, like the database or systems managing LLM credentials.  
  * **Current Implementation Analysis:**  
    * **Basic Container Isolation:** docker-compose.yml:37-38 provides network namespace separation between services  
    * **Service Dependency Control:** docker-compose.yml:15-16 enforces startup dependencies ensuring proper service initialization order  
    * **Limited Segmentation:** Missing traffic filtering, port restrictions, or communication policies between network segments  
    * **Provider Access Unrestricted:** No network-level controls for LLM provider communications, relying solely on SDK-level security  
    * **Infrastructure Security Gaps:** Missing implementation of network security groups, VPC controls, or micro-segmentation policies  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** Network traffic to and from the API components (including communication with LLM providers and database) is strictly controlled based on "need-to-communicate." Micro-segmentation limits the blast radius of a potential compromise.

## **Continuous Monitoring Verification**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Logging and Auditing Mechanisms for API and LLM Interactions  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Continuous Monitoring Verification)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Request Correlation:** app/logs/middleware.py:11-47 StructlogMiddleware implementing comprehensive request tracking with UUID generation and context binding  
    * **Logging Infrastructure:** app/logs/logging\_config.py:11-48 structured logging configuration with JSON formatting for production environments  
    * **Context Management:** app/logs/logging\_context.py provides request\_id propagation across service boundaries  
    * **Security Event Logging:** app/auth/dependencies.py:32-43 logs authentication failures and API key access patterns  
    * **Usage Auditing:** app/services/billing.py:13-23 logs LLM usage for compliance and audit trails  
    * **Provider Interaction Logging:** app/providers/vertex\_ai/vertexai.py:80-99-116 captures model metrics and LLM interaction details  
    * **Missing PIIFilteringProcessor:** Referenced in original document but not implemented in app/logs/logging\_config.py:1-54  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:  
    Zero Trust relies on comprehensive visibility into all activities. All API requests, LLM interactions, authentication/authorization decisions, and errors must be logged to support security monitoring, anomaly detection, and incident response.  
  * **Potential Risks from a Zero Trust Perspective:**  
    * **Insufficient Log Detail:** Logs lacking critical information like request\_id, authenticated user/API key identifier (manager\_id), source IP, requested model, invoked provider, token counts, or precise timestamps.  
    * **Failure to Log Security-Relevant Events:** Not logging failed authentication attempts, authorization failures, or errors from LLM providers.  
    * **Inconsistent Logging:** Different log formats or levels of detail across various components.  
    * **PII Leakage in Logs:** PIIFilteringProcessor being ineffective, leading to sensitive data from prompts/responses being logged (violates data minimization and security).  
    * **Logs Not Tamper-Evident or Centrally Aggregated:** If logs can be easily modified or are not sent to a secure, centralized logging system for analysis.  
  * **Current Implementation Analysis:**  
    * **Strong Request Correlation:** app/logs/middleware.py:14-24 provides comprehensive request context including client IP, user agent, and unique request ID  
    * **Structured Security Logging:** app/logs/logging\_config.py:22-29 implements production-ready JSON logging with proper timestamp and log level management  
    * **Authentication Event Tracking:** app/auth/dependencies.py:30-36 logs API key ID for request correlation and audit trails  
    * **Performance Monitoring:** app/providers/vertex\_ai/vertexai.py:80-99-116 captures latency metrics and usage statistics for operational monitoring  
    * **Critical Gaps:** Missing PIIFilteringProcessor, no external SIEM integration, and limited security-specific event categorization  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** Comprehensive, consistent, and secure logging of all API and LLM interactions, providing the necessary visibility for continuous security monitoring, threat detection, and auditing in line with Zero Trust principles.

## **Data Security**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Protection of Data In Transit and At Rest, Especially LLM Prompts/Responses  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Data Security)  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **Encryption In Transit:**  
      * **Provider Communications:** LLM provider SDKs use HTTPS by default for secure communication to Bedrock and Vertex AI  
      * **Database Connections:** app/config/settings.py:41-45 PostgreSQL connection string without explicit SSL/TLS configuration  
      * **Client Communications:** HTTPS termination typically handled at infrastructure level (load balancer/API gateway)  
    * **Data Protection At Rest:**  
      * **API Key Security:** app/auth/utils.py:12-22 implements SHA256 hashing with secure comparison using secrets.compare\_digest  
      * **User Data Storage:** app/users/models.py stores PII (email, name) without explicit encryption beyond database-level protection  
      * **Memory Security:** LLM prompts/responses processed in application memory without explicit secure memory handling  
      * **Database Encryption:** Relies on PostgreSQL database-level encryption (infrastructure responsibility)  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:  
    Data, especially potentially sensitive information in LLM prompts and responses, must be protected at all stages. Zero Trust mandates strong data security controls.  
  * **Potential Risks from a Zero Trust Perspective:**  
    * **Unencrypted Communication:**  
      * API exposed over HTTP instead of HTTPS.  
      * API to database communication unencrypted.  
      * (Less likely) Provider SDKs misconfigured to use HTTP.  
    * **Weak Encryption:** Use of outdated TLS versions or weak ciphers.  
    * **Insecure Storage of Secrets:** API keys stored in plaintext (not the case here, they are hashed), or LLM provider credentials managed insecurely by the API application environment.  
    * **Sensitive Data in Memory:** Prompts/responses containing sensitive data handled insecurely in application memory during processing (e.g., logged inadvertently, exposed via debugging endpoints if misconfigured).  
    * **PII Handling in LLM Data:** The API proxies data to LLMs. If users submit PII in prompts, or LLMs generate PII, the API framework itself doesn't inspect or encrypt this specific content within the payload, relying on transport encryption and provider security. The risk is the policy and user awareness around this.  
  * **Current Implementation Analysis:**  
    * **Strong Cryptographic Practices:** app/auth/utils.py:4-22 uses cryptographically secure random generation and proper hash comparison  
    * **Provider Security:** LLM provider SDKs handle HTTPS encryption for external communications by default  
    * **Database Connection Gaps:** app/config/settings.py:41-45 PostgreSQL connection lacks explicit SSL/TLS enforcement  
    * **Memory Security Concerns:** No explicit secure memory handling for sensitive LLM data during request processing  
    * **Infrastructure Dependencies:** Relies on external infrastructure for client-facing TLS termination and database encryption  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** All data, particularly LLM prompts/responses and credentials, is encrypted in transit and sensitive data at rest (like API key hashes) is appropriately protected. Data handling practices minimize exposure.

## **Zero Trust API Design Verification**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Explicit Trust Boundaries and Contextual Access Decisions  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Zero Trust API Design Verification)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Explicit Authentication:** app/auth/dependencies.py:16-45 provides mandatory API key verification with comprehensive validation checks  
    * **Granular Authorization:** app/auth/dependencies.py:48-66 RequiresScope decorator enforces explicit permission verification for every protected endpoint  
    * **Input Validation Framework:** app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py Pydantic schemas provide comprehensive request validation with type safety  
    * **Data Validation:** app/providers/utils.py parse\_data\_uri implements explicit validation for multimodal content  
    * **Model Authorization:** app/providers/dependencies.py Backend dependency ensures only configured and authorized models are accessible  
    * **Trust Boundary Enforcement:** Each endpoint in app/routers/api\_v1.py:33-70 explicitly requires authentication and authorization  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:  
    The API design should avoid implicit trust. Every interaction (client-to-API, API-to-provider, API-to-DB) should involve explicit verification and authorization based on available context.  
  * **Potential Risks from a Zero Trust Perspective:**  
    * **Implicit Trust in Internal Calls:** If one internal API function calls another without re-validating identity or necessary permissions, assuming the initial check was sufficient.  
    * **Lack of Context in Authorization:** Authorization decisions based solely on static scopes, without considering dynamic context (e.g., if a model is temporarily disabled for maintenance, or if an API key shows anomalous usage patterns – advanced ZT).  
    * **Trusting User Input without Validation:** Passing unvalidated parts of user input directly to LLM provider SDKs in a way that could bypass intended adapter logic or exploit SDK vulnerabilities (Pydantic validation mitigates much of this for structured parts).  
    * **Trusting LLM Output Implicitly:** (Covered in API10:2023) Assuming LLM output is always benign without any checks, if such checks were deemed necessary by policy.  
  * **Current Implementation Analysis:**  
    * **Explicit Verification Points:** app/auth/dependencies.py:16-66 implements mandatory authentication and authorization at every API boundary  
    * **Comprehensive Input Validation:** Pydantic schemas provide automatic validation and type safety for all API inputs  
    * **No Implicit Trust:** app/routers/api\_v1.py:33-70 requires explicit dependency injection for all authentication and authorization decisions  
    * **Model Access Control:** Backend selection logic ensures only authorized models are accessible through configuration mapping  
    * **Context-Aware Limitations:** Current implementation lacks dynamic context evaluation and adaptive trust decisions  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** The API design embodies Zero Trust by explicitly verifying identity, authorizing access, and validating data at every critical interaction point, especially before calling downstream LLM services. Trust is never assumed.

## **Identity-Centric Security Testing**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Management and Verification of Identities (API Keys, User Accounts)  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Identity-Centric Security Testing)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **API Key Identity Management:** app/auth/models.py:12-32 comprehensive API key lifecycle with creation, expiration, and usage tracking  
    * **User Identity Framework:** app/users/models.py defines user accounts as managers of API keys with role-based access  
    * **Identity Creation Process:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py:22-71 implements secure user and API key creation with proper hashing  
    * **Authentication Services:** app/routers/tokens.py provides JWT-based authentication for API key management operations  
    * **Identity Verification:** app/routers/users.py implements /users/me endpoint for identity validation and profile access  
    * **Cryptographic Foundation:** app/auth/utils.py:4-24 provides secure key generation and verification primitives  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:  
    Zero Trust is identity-centric. The security of LLM interactions hinges on robustly managing and verifying the identities (API keys, and the users/agencies they belong to) making the requests.  
  * **Potential Risks from a Zero Trust Perspective:**  
    * **Weak API Key Generation/Entropy:** Keys that are guessable or have low complexity.  
    * **Insecure API Key Distribution/Storage by Users:** (Outside direct API control, but impacts overall identity security).  
    * **Flaws in User Account Management:** Vulnerabilities in how users (who manage API keys) are created, authenticated (/auth/token), or have their details managed (/users/me). A compromised user account leads to compromised API keys.  
    * **Identity Lifecycle Gaps:** No clear process for de-provisioning API keys or user accounts when they are no longer needed or if an agency relationship ends.  
    * **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Users Managing API Keys:** (For the /auth/token flow, if it were for a human-facing management UI).  
  * **Current Implementation Analysis:**  
    * **Strong Identity Framework:** app/auth/models.py:12-32 implements comprehensive identity attributes including creation, expiration, and activity tracking  
    * **Secure Key Generation:** app/auth/utils.py:4-14 uses cryptographically secure random generation with proper entropy (32 bytes default)  
    * **Lifecycle Management:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py:22-71 provides secure identity creation but lacks automated lifecycle processes  
    * **Identity Verification:** app/auth/dependencies.py:25-44 implements thorough identity validation including expiration and status checks  
    * **Management Gaps:** Missing automated key rotation, identity deprovisioning, and multi-factor authentication for administrative functions  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** All identities (API keys, users) are strongly managed throughout their lifecycle. Identity verification is robust for every LLM API request and for any management actions related to identities.

## **Zero Trust Maturity Assessment & Multi-Layer Defense Validation**

These are higher-level strategic testing aspects rather than specific code risk surfaces. The "risk surfaces" are the overall architecture and the collection of security controls.

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Overall API Architecture and Security Control Integration  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Zero Trust Maturity Assessment, Multi-Layer Defense Validation)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Authentication Layer:** app/auth/dependencies.py:16-66 first line of defense with API key validation and scope checking  
    * **Input Validation Layer:** Pydantic schemas and app/providers/utils.py providing data validation and sanitization  
    * **Authorization Layer:** RequiresScope implementation ensuring granular permission enforcement  
    * **Logging and Monitoring:** app/logs/middleware.py:11-47 providing comprehensive audit trail and security event capture  
    * **Network Layer:** docker-compose.yml:37-38 basic network isolation between services  
    * **Infrastructure Dependencies:** External load balancers, WAFs, IAM roles, and LLM provider security  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:  
    Assessing how well the various security controls (authentication, authorization, input validation, logging, network controls, data security) work together to implement a Zero Trust model for LLM interactions. This involves testing the "defense-in-depth" strategy.  
  * **Potential Risks from a Zero Trust Perspective:**  
    * **Siloed Security Controls:** Controls implemented but not effectively integrated, leaving gaps.  
    * **Single Points of Failure:** Over-reliance on a single security control (e.g., only a perimeter firewall without strong internal authZ for LLM access).  
    * **Bypassable Controls:** One layer of defense being easily bypassed, negating deeper controls.  
    * **Inability to Contain Breaches:** If one component is compromised (e.g., an API instance), lack of internal controls allowing an attacker to easily access LLM provider credentials or other sensitive data.  
    * **Security Controls Not Adapting to LLM-Specific Threats:** Generic controls not sufficient for risks like prompt injection or model abuse.  
  * **Current Implementation Analysis:**  
    * **Defense Coordination:** Multiple security layers work together but lack explicit coordination mechanisms for adaptive response  
    * **Control Independence:** Authentication, authorization, and validation operate independently reducing single points of failure  
    * **Monitoring Integration:** app/logs/middleware.py:11-47 provides cross-layer visibility for security event correlation  
    * **Containment Limitations:** Basic network isolation exists but lacks advanced breach containment or lateral movement prevention  
    * **Integration Gaps:** Missing coordination between application-level security controls and infrastructure security measures  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** Multiple layers of security controls effectively enforce Zero Trust principles throughout the API request lifecycle, including LLM interactions. The system is resilient to individual control failures and can contain breaches.

## **Zero Trust Observability Testing**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring for Security Analytics  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Zero Trust Observability Testing)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Comprehensive Logging Framework:** app/logs/middleware.py:11-47 captures request lifecycle, timing, and security context  
    * **Identity Tracking:** app/logs/middleware.py:38-39 binds API key ID to request context for identity-centric monitoring  
    * **LLM Interaction Monitoring:** app/providers/vertex\_ai/vertexai.py:80-99-116 logs model usage, latency, and token consumption  
    * **Security Event Logging:** Authentication failures and authorization decisions captured through structured logging  
    * **Context Enrichment:** app/logs/middleware.py:17-24 includes client IP, user agent, and request parameters for security analysis  
    * **Missing SIEM Integration:** No external monitoring system integration or security analytics platform connectivity found  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:  
    Observability is key to Zero Trust – continuously monitoring who is accessing what LLM resources, detecting anomalies, and responding to threats.  
  * **Potential Risks from a Zero Trust Perspective:**  
    * **Blind Spots:** Critical actions or data points related to LLM requests not being logged or monitored.  
    * **Delayed Detection:** Logs not processed or analyzed in near real-time, delaying detection of attacks or misuse.  
    * **Ineffective Alerting:** Monitoring in place but alerts not configured, ignored, or generating too many false positives.  
    * **Inability to Correlate Events:** Logs from different components (API, IAM, LLM provider audit logs) not easily correlated to reconstruct an attack or misuse scenario involving LLMs.  
    * **Lack of LLM-Specific Anomaly Detection:** Not monitoring for patterns indicative of prompt injection attempts, data exfiltration attempts via LLMs, or model abuse.  
  * **Current Implementation Analysis:**  
    * **Rich Logging Infrastructure:** app/logs/middleware.py:11-47 provides comprehensive request context and security event capture  
    * **Identity-Centric Monitoring:** Strong correlation between API keys, requests, and LLM usage through structured logging  
    * **Performance Monitoring:** app/providers/vertex\_ai/vertexai.py captures detailed LLM interaction metrics for operational visibility  
    * **Security Analytics Gaps:** Missing external SIEM integration, automated anomaly detection, and LLM-specific threat monitoring  
    * **Response Automation:** No automated incident response or adaptive security controls based on monitoring data  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** The API provides sufficient observability (logs, metrics, traces) to enable continuous monitoring, security analytics, anomaly detection, and rapid response to security incidents related to LLM usage, supporting a dynamic and adaptive Zero Trust posture.

## **Context-Aware Access Control**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Dynamic Trust Evaluation and Adaptive Authorization  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Zero Trust API Design Verification, Context-Aware Access)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Static Authorization:** app/auth/dependencies.py:48-66 RequiresScope implements scope-based authorization without dynamic context  
    * **Request Context:** app/logs/middleware.py:17-24 captures client IP, user agent, and request parameters but not used for authorization decisions  
    * **Missing Context Framework:** No implementation of dynamic trust evaluation based on request patterns, IP reputation, or behavioral analysis  
    * **Static Configuration:** app/config/settings.py backend mapping lacks dynamic access control based on security context  
    * **Authentication State:** app/auth/models.py:25 last\_used\_at tracking but no anomaly detection or adaptive controls  
  * **Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:**  
    Zero Trust requires continuous evaluation of trust based on context including user behavior, request patterns, and environmental factors, not just static credentials.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **No Dynamic Context Evaluation:** Authorization decisions based solely on static API key scopes without considering request context  
    * **Missing Behavioral Analysis:** No detection of unusual access patterns, model usage, or request characteristics  
    * **Static Trust Decisions:** Authentication and authorization provide binary allow/deny without adaptive trust levels  
    * **No Risk-Based Access:** Missing implementation of risk-based access controls that adapt to security context  
    * **Limited Context Utilization:** Rich request context captured but not integrated into authorization decisions  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** Authorization decisions incorporate dynamic context including request patterns, client behavior, and security posture to provide adaptive access control that continuously evaluates and adjusts trust levels.

## **Identity Lifecycle and Key Management**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Automated Identity Provisioning and Key Rotation  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Identity-Centric Security Testing, Identity Lifecycle)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Manual Key Creation:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py:22-71 requires manual execution for user and API key creation  
    * **Key Storage:** app/auth/models.py:14-26 supports expiration dates and activity tracking but lacks automated lifecycle management  
    * **No Rotation Framework:** Missing automated key rotation capabilities or rotation scheduling  
    * **Static Lifecycle:** app/auth/utils.py:4-24 provides key generation but no automated lifecycle management  
    * **Manual Deprovisioning:** No automated processes for key deactivation or user account cleanup  
  * **Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Zero Trust Alignment:**  
    Zero Trust requires robust identity lifecycle management including automated provisioning, regular key rotation, and prompt deprovisioning to maintain security posture.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **Manual Provisioning:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py requires manual intervention for identity creation  
    * **No Automated Rotation:** Missing scheduled or event-triggered API key rotation capabilities  
    * **Static Key Management:** API keys remain active until manual intervention without automated lifecycle management  
    * **No Deprovisioning Automation:** Missing automated processes for removing inactive or compromised identities  
    * **Limited Lifecycle Tracking:** app/auth/models.py:25 tracks usage but doesn't automate lifecycle decisions  
  * **Expected Zero Trust Outcome:** Comprehensive automated identity lifecycle management including provisioning, rotation, monitoring, and deprovisioning with minimal manual intervention and strong audit trails.

## **Security Posture Assessment**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Zero Trust Maturity Measurement and Control Validation  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.12 (Zero Trust Maturity Assessment, Control Verification)  
  * **Code Components:**  
    * **Authentication Controls:** app/auth/dependencies.py:16-66 implements comprehensive authentication and authorization
