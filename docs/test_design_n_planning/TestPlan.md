# API Test Plan: GSAi \- Version v1

**Test Plan Identifier:** `GSAi_V1_[Date]`

## 1\. Introduction & Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the `GSAi` Application Programming Interface (API), Version `v1`. This API is designed for consumption by `[List External Agencies, e.g., Agency A, Agency B,]`.

**Primary Objectives:**

* **Functional Correctness:** Verify that all API endpoints and features operate as specified in `OpenAI Chat Completions API and embedding API (see docs/adr/001_Open_AI_API.md)` and meet defined requirements for all consuming agencies. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.1.3, NIST SP 800-228 Sec 3.1)  
* **Security:** Ensure the API and its data are rigorously protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and common vulnerabilities, adhering to Zero Trust principles. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3, Sec 6.6; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2, Sec 3.2)  
* **Performance & Scalability:** Validate the API's ability to handle expected and peak operational loads from all concurrent agency users, meeting defined response times and scaling efficiently. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 4.7, NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.4)  
* **Reliability & Availability:** Demonstrate consistent operational stability, graceful error handling, and minimal downtime for all connected agencies. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 4.7)  
* **Usability (Developer Experience \- DX):** Confirm the API is straightforward for agency developers to understand, integrate, and utilize effectively, supported by clear documentation.  
* **Interoperability & Compatibility:** Prove the API works correctly with diverse agency systems and that API evolution maintains backward compatibility where specified. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 1.4.2, Appendix A \- Versioning)  
* **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to relevant DoD and NIST guidance, as well as any specific regulatory mandates applicable to `[Agency Name(s)]` (e.g., `[mention specific regulations if known]`).

This test plan is a living document and will be updated as the API evolves. It supports a DevSecOps approach, integrating testing throughout the API lifecycle. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 5\)

## 4\. Software Risk Issues

This section outlines potential software risk issues associated with the `GSAi` API, particularly in a multi-agency and security-conscious environment. These risks inform the testing focus and are categorized for clarity. (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2; DoD API Tech Guide Appendix B, C)

### **4.1 Authentication and Authorization Risks**

* **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA):**
    * **Risk:** API endpoints may improperly validate if a requesting agency (or user within that agency) has the right to access or manipulate specific data objects (e.g., another agency's models, specific chat sessions, or embedding results).
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized data disclosure, modification, or deletion across agency boundaries.
    * (Ref: OWASP API1:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.2)
* **Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA):**
    * **Risk:** Regular agency users might gain access to administrative functions or API endpoints intended for privileged users or other specific agency roles.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized execution of sensitive operations, system-wide configuration changes, or access to broader datasets.
    * (Ref: OWASP API5:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.2)
* **Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA):**
    * **Risk:**
        * **Excessive Data Exposure:** API responses might expose more object properties than necessary for the consuming agency or user, including sensitive internal attributes.
        * **Mass Assignment:** The API might allow an agency client to update object properties that should not be user-modifiable (e.g., changing a model's underlying provider or internal cost attributes).
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized read or write access to sensitive sub-elements of data, potentially leading to data leakage, corruption, or privilege escalation.
    * (Ref: OWASP API3:2023; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.2, Sec 2.5 )
* **Broken Authentication:**
    * **Risk:** Weaknesses in session management, token validation (e.g., JWT "alg:none"), credential handling (including API key lifecycle), or password policies can allow attackers to compromise tokens or assume identities. This includes risks like credential stuffing if authentication endpoints are not properly protected.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to agency data or functionalities, potentially full account takeover.
    * (Ref: OWASP API2:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.1; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.3)
* **Insider Threats:**
    * **Risk:** Individuals with legitimate access (e.g., `GSAi` administrators, privileged agency users) may misuse their privileges intentionally or unintentionally.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction of data; disruption of services.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appx B)
* **Confused Deputy Problem:**
    * **Risk:** If the API involves credential exchange or impersonation (e.g., one service calling another on behalf of a user/agency), it might be tricked into misusing its authority to perform actions on resources the original requester should not have access to.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access or modification.
    * (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.7.6)

### **4.2 Input and Output Validation Risks**

* **Injection Attacks:**
    * **Risk:** Malicious data injected into API inputs (e.g., chat messages, model parameters) could lead to SQL injection, NoSQL injection, OS command injection, or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if outputs are rendered insecurely by client applications.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized data access/modification, remote code execution, denial of service, or compromised client sessions.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.6.2)
* **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks:**
    * **Risk:** If the API parses XML input (even from trusted sources or internal systems), it could be vulnerable to XXE attacks, allowing access to internal files or systems.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, or server-side request forgery.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appx B)
* **Insufficient Input Validation:**
    * **Risk:** Failure to properly validate data types, formats, lengths, ranges, or business rules for incoming data.
    * **Impact:** System instability, crashes, unexpected behavior, data corruption, or exploitation leading to other vulnerabilities like injection or buffer overflows.
    * (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.6.1)
* **Data Exposure/Leakage in Responses:**
    * **Risk:** API responses (including error messages) might inadvertently include sensitive data not intended for the specific agency or user, such as internal system details, stack traces, or excessive user information.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized information disclosure, aiding attackers in further system reconnaissance.
    * (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.5; DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.3 )
* **Improper Error Handling Leading to Information Exposure:**
    * **Risk:** Generic or overly verbose error messages can reveal sensitive information about the API's internal workings, database structure, or flaws that an attacker can exploit.
    * **Impact:** Aiding attackers in understanding the system, identifying vulnerabilities, or bypassing security measures.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; OWASP API8:2023)

### **4.3 Resource Management and Availability Risks**

* **Unrestricted Resource Consumption:**
    * **Risk:** Lack of, or improperly configured, rate limits, quotas, payload size restrictions, or processing limits (e.g., on long-running AI model requests) can allow an attacker or buggy client to exhaust system resources. This includes specific risks like:
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwhelming the API with a high volume of requests or computationally expensive requests, leading to resource starvation (CPU, memory, storage).
        * **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** DoS attacks originating from multiple sources, often targeting network bandwidth or connection limits.
    * **Impact:** API unavailability for legitimate agency users, degraded performance, increased operational costs.
    * (Ref: OWASP API4:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.4)
* **Cascading Failures:**
    * **Risk:** A failure or performance degradation in one microservice, downstream AI model provider, or a shared resource (like a database) could trigger a chain reaction, leading to wider API unavailability.
    * **Impact:** Significant service disruption beyond the initial point of failure, making diagnosis and recovery complex.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appx C.5; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.6.1 referring to "Query of Death")
* **Automated Threats & Bot Abuse:**
    * **Risk:** Malicious bots or automated scripts might exploit API functionalities for unintended purposes (e.g., rapidly querying models to infer proprietary information, exhausting quotas, or attempting to find exploitable patterns in responses).
    * **Impact:** Service degradation, increased costs, potential data scraping, or skewed analytics.
    * (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 Sec 4.4.2)

### **4.4 Integration, Configuration, and Governance Risks**

* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    * **Risk:** If the API fetches resources from URLs provided directly or indirectly by an agency (e.g., for fetching data to enrich a model's context, or through configured webhooks), an attacker might coerce the API into making requests to unintended internal or external systems.
    * **Impact:** Internal network scanning, unauthorized access to internal services or cloud metadata, interaction with arbitrary third-party systems.
    * (Ref: OWASP API7:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.2)
* **Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows:**
    * **Risk:** APIs might expose legitimate business flows (e.g., model fine-tuning, bulk data processing requests, user provisioning if applicable across agencies) that, if accessed excessively or in an automated fashion by an authorized but malicious/compromised agency, could harm the service or other agencies (e.g., monopolizing shared AI resources, incurring unexpected costs).
    * **Impact:** Denial of service for other agencies, significant operational cost overruns, unfair resource allocation.
    * (Ref: OWASP API6:2023)
* **Unsafe Consumption of (Third-Party) APIs:**
    * **Risk:** The `GSAi` API, when interacting with downstream AI model providers (Bedrock, Vertex AI, etc.) or other internal/external services, might not sufficiently validate data received from these services or might handle their failures insecurely. Developers might implicitly trust these APIs more than end-user input.
    * **Impact:** Propagation of vulnerabilities from consumed APIs, data corruption, denial of service if consumed APIs are unreliable, or sensitive data exposure if trust boundaries are mishandled.
    * (Ref: OWASP API10:2023)
* **Security Misconfiguration:**
    * **Risk:** Incorrectly configured security settings at any layer (network, OS, API gateway, application server, AI model permissions), use of default credentials, unnecessary features enabled, verbose error messages, or missing security headers.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to various vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, information disclosure, or system compromise.
    * (Ref: OWASP API8:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2)
* **Insecure Data Transmission/Storage:**
    * **Risk:** Lack of transport layer encryption (TLS) for all communications, use of weak cryptographic algorithms, or insecure storage of sensitive data like API keys (even if hashed, consider salt and algorithm strength) or cached AI model outputs.
    * **Impact:** Data interception, eavesdropping, unauthorized access to sensitive information at rest or in transit.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.3, Appx B)
* **Integration & Interoperability Failures:**
    * **Risk:** Incompatibility with diverse agency technology stacks due to reliance on specific protocols/standards not universally supported. Misinterpretation of API contracts or data formats between `GSAi` and consuming agency systems. Backward compatibility failures during API updates impacting existing agency integrations.
    * **Impact:** Failed integrations, data corruption, inability for agencies to consume API services effectively.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 1.4.2)
* **Data Management Risks:**
    * **Risk:**
        * **Data Privacy Breaches:** Mishandling of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive agency-specific data processed by the models or logged by the API.
        * **Improper Data Isolation:** Risk of data leakage or cross-contamination between different agencies if multi-tenancy is not rigorously enforced at all levels (data storage, processing, AI model context).
        * **Lack of Data Integrity:** Data being corrupted during transmission, processing, or storage without adequate checks.
    * **Impact:** Regulatory non-compliance, loss of trust, reputational damage, incorrect AI model outputs based on corrupted data.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 5.1, Sec 3.3.3)
* **Governance & Visibility (Inventory Management):**
    * **Risk:** Proliferation of undocumented or "shadow" API endpoints, outdated API versions ("zombie" APIs) not covered by current security controls or monitoring, or lack of a clear inventory of API consumers (agencies) and their access levels.
    * **Impact:** Increased attack surface, unpatched vulnerabilities in older versions, inability to effectively manage security policies or respond to incidents.
    * (Ref: OWASP API9:2023; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.1)
* **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring for Security Events:**
    * **Risk:** Failure to log security-relevant events (e.g., authentication attempts, authorization failures, significant errors, changes to sensitive configurations) or monitor these logs for suspicious activity.
    * **Impact:** Inability to detect ongoing attacks, respond to security incidents effectively, or perform forensic analysis.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.4, Sec 4.7; OWASP API6:2023 refers to API10:2019 Insufficient Logging & Monitoring)

* **Ease of Integration:** "Time to First Call," simplicity of auth flows, intuitive API design.  
* **Error Message Utility:** Helpfulness of error messages for developer diagnosis.  
* **Developer Portal Usability:** (If applicable) Navigation, key management, interactive testing.

### 7.7. Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (CDCT)

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.4)

* **Strategy:** Employ CDCT to ensure API changes do not break existing agency integrations.  
* **Process:**  
  * Agencies (`[List participating agencies or describe selection process]`) define contracts specifying their API interaction expectations.  
  * Contracts managed via `[Tool, e.g., Pact Broker, shared repository]`.  
  * Provider-side verification integrated into CI/CD pipeline.  
* **Tools:** `[e.g., Pact, Spring Cloud Contract]`

### 7.8. API Versioning & Backward Compatibility Testing

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appendix A \- Versioning)

* **Strategy:** `URI Path Versioning - /api/v1`  
* **Backward Compatibility:** Test that new MINOR/PATCH versions do not break clients using older supported versions.  
  * Verify new optional parameters/response fields are handled gracefully by older clients.  
  * Run existing contract tests for older consumer versions against new API versions.  
* **Deprecation Policy Testing:** Verify behavior of deprecated endpoints (e.g., proper warning headers, eventual retirement).

### 7.9. Test Data Management Strategy

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.2.2)

* **Data Generation:** Primarily use synthetic data mimicking production patterns (e.g., test API keys from `create_admin_user.py`, sample prompts).  
* **Data Anonymization/Masking:** If production-derived data is used, ensure all sensitive information (PII, PHI, CUI) is anonymized/masked according to `[Relevant data protection regulations/policies]`.  
* **Data Parameterization:** Design data-driven tests.  
* **Data Isolation:** Ensure test data isolation in shared environments.  
* **Data for Edge Cases & Negative Testing:** Comprehensive set of data for boundary, error, and invalid scenarios.  
* **Stateful Sequence Data Management:** Define creation, usage, and cleanup of data for multi-step tests.  
* More details are in:  
  * [APItest\_DataAnonymization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nAKS_vPMnVrnYz_uh6vBruui1X_rFRTyx1Sy73QmrTE/edit?usp=sharing)

### 7.10. Test Environment Strategy

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.2)

* **Environment(s):** `DEV (local with uv run fastapi dev as per README.md), TEST/QA, STAGING, PERF`  
* **Fidelity:** Environments to mirror production as closely as possible (configuration, dependencies like Postgres).  
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Utilize IaC for provisioning and managing test environments where possible. (DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.2.1)  
* **Dependency Management:** Use actual dependencies where stable (e.g., Postgres); otherwise, use mocks/stubs/virtual services for downstream systems (e.g., mock LLM backends for some tests, see `tests/unit/routers/conftest.py`).  
* **Ephemeral vs. Persistent:** `[Describe approach, e.g., Ephemeral environments for CI builds, persistent for UAT/Perf]`. (DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.2.1)  
* **Data Configuration:** Test databases populated with representative and isolated test data sets (Alembic used for DB migrations \- `alembic.ini`, `alembic/versions/`).

### 7.11. Automation Strategy

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.1)

* **Scope:** Automate functional, regression, contract, and performance tests. Security scans integrated into CI. Unit tests for auth (`tests/unit/auth/`) and providers (`tests/unit/providers/`) are present.  
* **Tools:** `Pytest (used for unit tests), Postman/Newman, Requests library (Python), Robot Framework`  
* **CI/CD Integration:** Automated tests integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (`[Specify CI/CD tool, e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions]`) triggered on `[e.g., every commit, nightly builds]`.  
* **Reporting:** Automated generation of comprehensive and actionable test reports.

### 7.12. Zero Trust Testing Strategy

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.6)

* **Authentication & Authorization:** Rigorous verification of identity (API Key) and access controls (Scopes) for every API request.  
* **Least Privilege:** Test that authenticated entities only have access to necessary resources and actions.  
* **Network Segmentation:** (If applicable) Verify that API interactions respect defined micro-segmentation policies.  
* **Continuous Monitoring Verification:** Test that API activities are logged appropriately (Structlog via `app/logs/logging_config.py`) to support continuous monitoring and anomaly detection.  
* **Data Security:** Verify data encryption in transit and at rest, and appropriate data handling based on classification.

## 8\. Item Pass/Fail Criteria

* **Individual Test Case:**  
  * **Pass:** Actual result matches expected result; no critical errors encountered.  
  * **Fail:** Actual result deviates from expected result; critical error encountered.  
* **API Endpoint/Feature:**  
  * **Pass:** `[e.g., 100% of critical priority test cases pass, and >=95% of high priority test cases pass. No outstanding Severity 1 or 2 defects.]`  
  * **Fail:** `[e.g., Any critical test case fails, or >5% of high priority test cases fail. Any Severity 1 or 2 defect remains open.]`  
* **Performance Test Cycle:**  
  * **Pass:** All KPIs (response time, throughput, error rate) are within `[X]%` of defined targets under `[specified load]`. System remains stable.  
  * **Fail:** Any KPI exceeds `[X]%` of target, or system becomes unstable.  
* **Security Test Cycle:**  
  * **Pass:** No vulnerabilities of `[Critical/High]` severity identified. All `[Medium]` severity vulnerabilities have a remediation plan.  
  * **Fail:** Any `[Critical/High]` severity vulnerability identified.  
* **Overall Release Readiness:**  
  * **Pass:** All features meet their pass criteria. No outstanding critical or high-severity defects. All security and performance criteria met. Consumer contracts verified.  
  * **Fail:** Otherwise.

## 9\. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements

### 9.1. Suspension Criteria
