# API Test Plan: GSAi \- Version v1

**Test Plan Identifier:** `GSAi_V1_[Date]`

## 1\. Introduction & Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the `GSAi` Application Programming Interface (API), Version `v1`. This API is designed for consumption by `[List External Agencies, e.g., Agency A, Agency B,]`.

**Primary Objectives:**

* **Functional Correctness:** Verify that all API endpoints and features operate as specified in `OpenAI Chat Completions API and embedding API (see docs/adr/001_Open_AI_API.md)` and meet defined requirements for all consuming agencies. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.1.3, NIST SP 800-228 Sec 3.1)  
* **Security:** Ensure the API and its data are rigorously protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and common vulnerabilities, adhering to Zero Trust principles. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3, Sec 6.6; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2, Sec 3.2)  
* **Performance & Scalability:** Validate the API's ability to handle expected and peak operational loads from all concurrent agency users, meeting defined response times and scaling efficiently. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 4.7, NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.4)  
* **Reliability & Availability:** Demonstrate consistent operational stability, graceful error handling, and minimal downtime for all connected agencies. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 4.7)  
* **Usability (Developer Experience \- DX):** Confirm the API is straightforward for agency developers to understand, integrate, and utilize effectively, supported by clear documentation.  
* **Interoperability & Compatibility:** Prove the API works correctly with diverse agency systems and that API evolution maintains backward compatibility where specified. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 1.4.2, Appendix A \- Versioning)  
* **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to relevant DoD and NIST guidance, as well as any specific regulatory mandates applicable to `[Agency Name(s)]` (e.g., `[mention specific regulations if known]`).

This test plan is a living document and will be updated as the API evolves. It supports a DevSecOps approach, integrating testing throughout the API lifecycle. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 5\)

* `Specific UI client applications consuming the API - Covered in separate UI test plans`  
* `Performance of third-party LLM services (e.g., Bedrock, Vertex AI actual model inference time) beyond the API's direct control - Assumed covered by vendor SLAs`  
* **Rationale for each exclusion.**

## 7\. Approach/Strategy

This section details the overall testing methodology, emphasizing alignment with DoD and NIST guidance.

### 7.1. Overall Testing Strategy

* **Lifecycle Integration:** Testing is integrated throughout the DevSecOps lifecycle, from design reviews to post-deployment monitoring. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 5\)  
* **Risk-Based Testing:** Prioritize testing efforts based on the risks identified in Section 4\.  
* **Automation-First:** Automate tests wherever feasible to ensure repeatability, efficiency, and continuous validation. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.1) *Pytest is used for unit tests (see `tests` directory).*  
* **Layered Testing:** Employ a mix of unit (e.g., `tests/unit`), integration, contract, application (end-to-end), security, and performance tests. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.1)

### 7.2. Functional and Validation Testing

* **Specification-Driven:** Test cases derived from API specifications (OpenAI API as per `docs/adr/001_Open_AI_API.md`) and functional requirements. (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 REC-API-1, REC-API-2)  
* **Input Validation:** Rigorous testing of input parameters, request bodies, and headers for valid and invalid data, including boundary values, data types, formats, and schema conformance (based on Pydantic schemas e.g., `app/providers/open_ai/schemas.py`). (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 REC-API-13, REC-API-18; DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.2)  
* **Response Validation:** Verification of HTTP status codes, headers, and response payloads against expected outcomes and schemas.  
* **Business Logic Validation:** Testing of underlying business rules and workflows (e.g., model selection based on capability in `app/providers/dependencies.py`).  
* **Pre-runtime Protection Verification:** Tests to ensure API specifications are accurate, schemas are correctly defined and enforced. (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 Sec 3.1)

### 7.3. Security Testing

  * Test for broken object-level authorization (BOLA), broken function-level authorization, and broken object property level authorization. (NIST SP 800-228 REC-API-12, REC-API-19)  
  * Ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege (via Scopes).  
  * Test token validation (API key active status, expiry as per `app/auth/dependencies.py`).  
  * Validate identity canonicalization if applicable. (NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.7)  
* **Input Validation & Injection Prevention:**  
  * Test for common injection vulnerabilities (SQLi, NoSQLi, XSS, Command Injection, XXE). (DoD API Tech Guide App B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.6.2)  
  * Fuzz testing with malformed and unexpected inputs. (DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.6.3)  
* **Data Exposure Testing:**  
  * Verify that only intended data is exposed in responses.  
  * Test for sensitive data leakage in error messages or logs (ensure `request_id` from `app/logs/logging_context.py` doesn't expose sensitive info). (NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.5, REC-API-20)  
  * Ensure proper encryption of data in transit (HTTPS/TLS mandatory \- *FastAPI runs over HTTP by default, HTTPS is a deployment concern*) and at rest (Postgres DB encryption). (DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.3)  
* **Rate Limiting & Resource Consumption Testing:**  
  * Verify effectiveness of rate limits and request throttling against DoS/DDoS and resource exhaustion. (NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.4, REC-API-15, REC-API-16) `[Verify if implemented]`  
* **Security Misconfiguration Testing:**  
  * Check for default credentials, unnecessary enabled features, verbose errors, missing security headers (e.g., HSTS, CSP). `CORSMiddleware` is used (`app/main.py`).  
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilize SAST, DAST tools. (DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.6)  
  * **SAST Tools:** `[e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx, Bandit for Python]`  
  * **DAST Tools:** `[e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Pro, Invicti]`

* **Idempotency Testing:** For relevant PUT/DELETE operations.  
* **API Call Sequence Testing:** Validate multi-step transactions.  
* Further details are at:

  * [APItest\_Call Sequence Testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubGpl2eoW6BrDmGX-ADwLCh8Bo4rxxvP5Z7jLk17AAg/edit?usp=sharing)

### 7.6. Usability Testing (Developer Experience \- DX)

* **Documentation Review:** Clarity, completeness, accuracy of API specs (`docs/adr/001_Open_AI_API.md`), tutorials (`Example_Notebook/Example.ipynb`), code samples.  
* **Ease of Integration:** "Time to First Call," simplicity of auth flows, intuitive API design.  
* **Error Message Utility:** Helpfulness of error messages for developer diagnosis.  
* **Developer Portal Usability:** (If applicable) Navigation, key management, interactive testing.

### 7.7. Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (CDCT)

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.4)

* **Strategy:** Employ CDCT to ensure API changes do not break existing agency integrations.  
* **Process:**  
  * Agencies (`[List participating agencies or describe selection process]`) define contracts specifying their API interaction expectations.  
  * Contracts managed via `[Tool, e.g., Pact Broker, shared repository]`.  
  * Provider-side verification integrated into CI/CD pipeline.  
* **Tools:** `[e.g., Pact, Spring Cloud Contract]`

### 7.8. API Versioning & Backward Compatibility Testing

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appendix A \- Versioning)

* **Strategy:** `URI Path Versioning - /api/v1`  
* **Backward Compatibility:** Test that new MINOR/PATCH versions do not break clients using older supported versions.  
  * Verify new optional parameters/response fields are handled gracefully by older clients.  
  * Run existing contract tests for older consumer versions against new API versions.  
* **Deprecation Policy Testing:** Verify behavior of deprecated endpoints (e.g., proper warning headers, eventual retirement).

### 7.9. Test Data Management Strategy

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.2.2)

* **Data Generation:** Primarily use synthetic data mimicking production patterns (e.g., test API keys from `create_admin_user.py`, sample prompts).  
* **Data Anonymization/Masking:** If production-derived data is used, ensure all sensitive information (PII, PHI, CUI) is anonymized/masked according to `[Relevant data protection regulations/policies]`.  
* **Data Parameterization:** Design data-driven tests.  
* **Data Isolation:** Ensure test data isolation in shared environments.  
* **Data for Edge Cases & Negative Testing:** Comprehensive set of data for boundary, error, and invalid scenarios.  
* **Stateful Sequence Data Management:** Define creation, usage, and cleanup of data for multi-step tests.  
* More details are in:  
  * [APItest\_DataAnonymization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nAKS_vPMnVrnYz_uh6vBruui1X_rFRTyx1Sy73QmrTE/edit?usp=sharing)

### 7.10. Test Environment Strategy

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.2)

* **Environment(s):** `DEV (local with uv run fastapi dev as per README.md), TEST/QA, STAGING, PERF`  
* **Fidelity:** Environments to mirror production as closely as possible (configuration, dependencies like Postgres).  
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Utilize IaC for provisioning and managing test environments where possible. (DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.2.1)  
* **Dependency Management:** Use actual dependencies where stable (e.g., Postgres); otherwise, use mocks/stubs/virtual services for downstream systems (e.g., mock LLM backends for some tests, see `tests/unit/routers/conftest.py`).  
* **Ephemeral vs. Persistent:** `[Describe approach, e.g., Ephemeral environments for CI builds, persistent for UAT/Perf]`. (DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.2.1)  
* **Data Configuration:** Test databases populated with representative and isolated test data sets (Alembic used for DB migrations \- `alembic.ini`, `alembic/versions/`).

### 7.11. Automation Strategy

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.1)

* **Scope:** Automate functional, regression, contract, and performance tests. Security scans integrated into CI. Unit tests for auth (`tests/unit/auth/`) and providers (`tests/unit/providers/`) are present.  
* **Tools:** `Pytest (used for unit tests), Postman/Newman, Requests library (Python), Robot Framework`  
* **CI/CD Integration:** Automated tests integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (`[Specify CI/CD tool, e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions]`) triggered on `[e.g., every commit, nightly builds]`.  
* **Reporting:** Automated generation of comprehensive and actionable test reports.

### 7.12. Zero Trust Testing Strategy

(Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.6)

* **Authentication & Authorization:** Rigorous verification of identity (API Key) and access controls (Scopes) for every API request.  
* **Least Privilege:** Test that authenticated entities only have access to necessary resources and actions.  
* **Network Segmentation:** (If applicable) Verify that API interactions respect defined micro-segmentation policies.  
* **Continuous Monitoring Verification:** Test that API activities are logged appropriately (Structlog via `app/logs/logging_config.py`) to support continuous monitoring and anomaly detection.  
* **Data Security:** Verify data encryption in transit and at rest, and appropriate data handling based on classification.

## 16\. Planning Risks and Contingencies

* **Risk:** Delay in development deliverables impacting test schedule.  
  * **Contingency:** Phased testing approach; prioritize critical path features; clear communication with development.  
* **Risk:** Test environment instability or unavailability.  
  * **Contingency:** Dedicated environment support; IaC for quick rebuilds; backup environment plan.  
* **Risk:** Underestimation of testing effort or complexity.  
  * **Contingency:** Regular progress reviews; re-prioritization of test scope; request additional resources if necessary.  
* **Risk:** Lack of skilled resources for specialized testing (e.g., security, performance).  
  * **Contingency:** Cross-training; engage external consultants; adjust schedule based on resource availability.  
* **Risk:** Difficulties in coordinating CDCT with multiple external agencies.  
  * **Contingency:** Phased agency onboarding for CDCT; dedicated communication liaison; flexible contract submission deadlines.  
* **Risk:** Test data preparation challenges for diverse agency scenarios.  
  * **Contingency:** Invest in data generation tools; allocate more time for data setup; collaborate with agencies for representative data (anonymized).  
* **Risk:** Tooling issues or licensing problems (e.g., `uv` for package management).  
  * **Contingency:** Identify backup tools; ensure licenses are procured in advance; dedicated tool support.
