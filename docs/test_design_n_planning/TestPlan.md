# API Test Plan: GSAi \- Version v1

**Test Plan Identifier:** `GSAi_V1_[Date]`

## 1\. Introduction & Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the `GSAi` Application Programming Interface (API), Version `v1`. This API is designed for consumption by `[List External Agencies, e.g., Agency A, Agency B,]`.

**Primary Objectives:**

* **Functional Correctness:** Verify that all API endpoints and features operate as specified in `OpenAI Chat Completions API and embedding API (see docs/adr/001_Open_AI_API.md)` and meet defined requirements for all consuming agencies. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 6.1.3, NIST SP 800-228 Sec 3.1)  
* **Security:** Ensure the API and its data are rigorously protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and common vulnerabilities, adhering to Zero Trust principles. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3, Sec 6.6; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2, Sec 3.2)  
* **Performance & Scalability:** Validate the API's ability to handle expected and peak operational loads from all concurrent agency users, meeting defined response times and scaling efficiently. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 4.7, NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.4)  
* **Reliability & Availability:** Demonstrate consistent operational stability, graceful error handling, and minimal downtime for all connected agencies. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 4.7)  
* **Usability (Developer Experience \- DX):** Confirm the API is straightforward for agency developers to understand, integrate, and utilize effectively, supported by clear documentation.  
* **Interoperability & Compatibility:** Prove the API works correctly with diverse agency systems and that API evolution maintains backward compatibility where specified. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 1.4.2, Appendix A \- Versioning)  
* **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to relevant FedRAMP, DoD, and NIST guidance, as well as any specific regulatory mandates applicable to `[Agency Name(s)]` (e.g., `[mention specific regulations if known]`).

This test plan is a living document and will be updated as the API evolves. It supports a DevSecOps approach, integrating testing throughout the API lifecycle. (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 5\)

## 4\. Software Risk Issues

### **4.1 Authentication and Authorization Risks**
* **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA):**
    * **Risk:** API endpoints may improperly validate if a requesting agency (or user within that agency) has the right to access or manipulate specific data objects (e.g., another agency's models, specific chat sessions, or embedding results).
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized data disclosure, modification, or deletion across agency boundaries.
    * (Ref: OWASP API1:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.2)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.10.1, 7.3.1 (API1), 7.3.5, 7.12

* **Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA):**
    * **Risk:** Regular agency users might gain access to administrative functions or API endpoints intended for privileged users or other specific agency roles.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized execution of sensitive operations, system-wide configuration changes, or access to broader datasets.
    * (Ref: OWASP API5:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.2)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.2.3, 5.10.1, 7.3.1 (API5), 7.3.4, 7.3.5, 7.12

* **Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA):**
    * **Risk:**
        * **Excessive Data Exposure:** API responses might expose more object properties than necessary for the consuming agency or user, including sensitive internal attributes.
        * **Mass Assignment:** The API might allow an agency client to update object properties that should not be user-modifiable (e.g., changing a model's underlying provider or internal cost attributes).
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized read or write access to sensitive sub-elements of data, potentially leading to data leakage, corruption, or privilege escalation.
    * (Ref: OWASP API3:2023; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.2, Sec 2.5)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.10.1, 7.3.1 (API3), 7.3.5, 7.9

* **Broken Authentication:**
    * **Risk:** Weaknesses in session management, token validation (e.g., JWT "alg:none"), credential handling (including API key lifecycle), or password policies can allow attackers to compromise tokens or assume identities. This includes risks like credential stuffing if authentication endpoints are not properly protected.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to agency data or functionalities, potentially full account takeover.
    * (Ref: OWASP API2:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.1; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.3)

    * **Risk:** Individuals with legitimate access (e.g., `GSAi` administrators, privileged agency users) may misuse their privileges intentionally or unintentionally.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction of data; disruption of services.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appx B)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.2.3, 5.10.1, 5.11.1, 5.11.3, 7.3.4, 7.3.5, 7.12

* **Confused Deputy Problem:**
    * **Risk:** If the API involves credential exchange or impersonation (e.g., one service calling another on behalf of a user/agency), it might be tricked into misusing its authority to perform actions on resources the original requester should not have access to.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access or modification.
    * (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.7.6)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.2.3, 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.3, 7.3.1 (API5), 7.3.5, 7.10

### **4.2 Input and Output Validation Risks**
* **Injection Attacks:**
    * **Risk:** Malicious data injected into API inputs (e.g., chat messages, model parameters) could lead to SQL injection, NoSQL injection, OS command injection, or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if outputs are rendered insecurely by client applications.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized data access/modification, remote code execution, denial of service, or compromised client sessions.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.6.2)

    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; OWASP API8:2023)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.6, 7.3.1 (API8), 7.5.1, 7.5.7, 7.6

### **4.3 Resource Management and Availability Risks**
* **Unrestricted Resource Consumption:**
    * **Risk:** Lack of, or improperly configured, rate limits, quotas, payload size restrictions, or processing limits (e.g., on long-running AI model requests) can allow an attacker or buggy client to exhaust system resources. This includes specific risks like:
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwhelming the API with a high volume of requests or computationally expensive requests, leading to resource starvation (CPU, memory, storage).
        * **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** DoS attacks originating from multiple sources, often targeting network bandwidth or connection limits.
    * **Impact:** API unavailability for legitimate agency users, degraded performance, increased operational costs.
    * (Ref: OWASP API4:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.4)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.9.5, 5.9.6, 7.3.1 (API4), 7.4, 7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.4.3, 7.4.5, 7.5.4, 7.5.5

* **Cascading Failures:**
    * **Risk:** A failure or performance degradation in one microservice, downstream AI model provider, or a shared resource (like a database) could trigger a chain reaction, leading to wider API unavailability.
    * **Impact:** Significant service disruption beyond the initial point of failure, making diagnosis and recovery complex.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Appx C.5; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2.6.1 referring to "Query of Death")

* **Automated Threats & Bot Abuse:**
    * **Risk:** Malicious bots or automated scripts might exploit API functionalities for unintended purposes (e.g., rapidly querying models to infer proprietary information, exhausting quotas, or attempting to find exploitable patterns in responses).
    * **Impact:** Service degradation, increased costs, potential data scraping, or skewed analytics.
    * (Ref: NIST SP 800-228 Sec 4.4.2)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.9.6, 7.3.1 (API6), 7.3.2, 7.4.3, 7.5.4, 7.5.7

### **4.4 Integration, Configuration, and Governance Risks**
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    * **Risk:** If the API fetches resources from URLs provided directly or indirectly by an agency (e.g., for fetching data to enrich a model's context, or through configured webhooks), an attacker might coerce the API into making requests to unintended internal or external systems.
    * **Impact:** Internal network scanning, unauthorized access to internal services or cloud metadata, interaction with arbitrary third-party systems.
    * (Ref: OWASP API7:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.2)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.3.1, 5.3.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 7.3.1 (API7), 7.3.5, 7.12

* **Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows:**
    * **Risk:** APIs might expose legitimate business flows (e.g., model fine-tuning, bulk data processing requests, user provisioning if applicable across agencies) that, if accessed excessively or in an automated fashion by an authorized but malicious/compromised agency, could harm the service or other agencies (e.g., monopolizing shared AI resources, incurring unexpected costs).
    * **Impact:** Denial of service for other agencies, significant operational cost overruns, unfair resource allocation.
    * (Ref: OWASP API6:2023)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.7.1, 5.7.2, 5.9.6, 7.3.1 (API6), 7.4.5, 7.5.7

* **Unsafe Consumption of (Third-Party) APIs:**
    * **Risk:** The `GSAi` API, when interacting with downstream AI model providers (Bedrock, Vertex AI, etc.) or other internal/external services, might not sufficiently validate data received from these services or might handle their failures insecurely. Developers might implicitly trust these APIs more than end-user input.
    * **Impact:** Propagation of vulnerabilities from consumed APIs, data corruption, denial of service if consumed APIs are unreliable, or sensitive data exposure if trust boundaries are mishandled.
    * (Ref: OWASP API10:2023)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.3.1, 5.3.3, 5.3.4, 5.5.2, 7.3.1 (API10), 7.5.2, 7.5.4, 7.5.5

* **Security Misconfiguration:**
    * **Risk:** Incorrectly configured security settings at any layer (network, OS, API gateway, application server, AI model permissions), use of default credentials, unnecessary features enabled, verbose error messages, or missing security headers.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to various vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, information disclosure, or system compromise.
    * (Ref: OWASP API8:2023; DoD API Tech Guide Appx B; NIST SP 800-228 Sec 2)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.2.1, 5.6, 5.10.1, 7.3.1 (API8), 7.3.4, 7.3.5, 7.10

* **Insecure Data Transmission/Storage:**
    * **Risk:** Lack of transport layer encryption (TLS) for all communications, use of weak cryptographic algorithms, or insecure storage of sensitive data like API keys (even if hashed, consider salt and algorithm strength) or cached AI model outputs.
    * **Impact:** Data interception, eavesdropping, unauthorized access to sensitive information at rest or in transit.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 3.3.3, Appx B)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.2.1, 5.8.1, 5.10.1, 7.3.1 (API8), 7.3.4, 7.3.5, 7.12

* **Integration & Interoperability Failures:**
    * **Risk:** Incompatibility with diverse agency technology stacks due to reliance on specific protocols/standards not universally supported. Misinterpretation of API contracts or data formats between `GSAi` and consuming agency systems. Backward compatibility failures during API updates impacting existing agency integrations.
    * **Impact:** Failed integrations, data corruption, inability for agencies to consume API services effectively.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 1.4.2)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 5.13.1, 5.13.2, 5.13.3, 5.13.4, 5.14, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8

* **Data Management Risks:**
    * **Risk:**
        * **Data Privacy Breaches:** Mishandling of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive agency-specific data processed by the models or logged by the API.
        * **Improper Data Isolation:** Risk of data leakage or cross-contamination between different agencies if multi-tenancy is not rigorously enforced at all levels (data storage, processing, AI model context).
        * **Lack of Data Integrity:** Data being corrupted during transmission, processing, or storage without adequate checks.
    * **Impact:** Regulatory non-compliance, loss of trust, reputational damage, incorrect AI model outputs based on corrupted data.
    * (Ref: DoD API Tech Guide Sec 5.1, Sec 3.3.3)
    * **Addressed by:** 5.5.2, 5.10.1, 5.11.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.4,

## 16\. Planning Risks and Contingencies

* **Risk:** Delay in development deliverables impacting test schedule.  
  * **Contingency:** Phased testing approach; prioritize critical path features; clear communication with development.  
* **Risk:** Test environment instability or unavailability.  
  * **Contingency:** Dedicated environment support; IaC for quick rebuilds; backup environment plan.  
* **Risk:** Underestimation of testing effort or complexity.  
  * **Contingency:** Regular progress reviews; re-prioritization of test scope; request additional resources if necessary.  
* **Risk:** Lack of skilled resources for specialized testing (e.g., security, performance).  
  * **Contingency:** Cross-training; engage external consultants; adjust schedule based on resource availability.  
* **Risk:** Difficulties in coordinating CDCT with multiple external agencies.  
  * **Contingency:** Phased agency onboarding for CDCT; dedicated communication liaison; flexible contract submission deadlines.  
* **Risk:** Test data preparation challenges for diverse agency scenarios.  
  * **Contingency:** Invest in data generation tools; allocate more time for data setup; collaborate with agencies for representative data (anonymized).  
* **Risk:** Tooling issues or licensing problems (e.g., `uv` for package management).  
  * **Contingency:** Identify backup tools; ensure licenses are procured in advance; dedicated tool support.
