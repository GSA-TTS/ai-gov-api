# Test Cases for Zero Trust: Context-Aware Access Control

This document outlines test cases related to Context-Aware Access Control for the GSAi API Framework, based on Zero Trust testing strategies detailed in Section 7.12 of the TestPlan.md.

**Test Cases Summary: 12 (Original: 4, Enhanced: +8)**

**Referenced Code Components:**
* **Static Authorization:** app/auth/dependencies.py:48-66 RequiresScope implements scope-based authorization without dynamic context
* **Request Context:** app/logs/middleware.py:17-24 captures client IP, user agent, and request parameters but not used for authorization decisions
* **Missing Context Framework:** No implementation of dynamic trust evaluation based on request patterns, IP reputation, or behavioral analysis
* **Static Configuration:** app/config/settings.py backend mapping lacks dynamic access control based on security context
* **Authentication State:** app/auth/models.py:25 last_used_at tracking but no anomaly detection or adaptive controls

### **ZTA_CAAC_001**
* **ID:** ZTA_CAAC_001
* **Category Ref:** Context-Aware Access Control
* **Description:** Verify authorization decisions are based on static API key scopes, not dynamic request context.
* **Exposure Point(s):** `RequiresScope` class (`app/auth/dependencies.py:48-66`), `StructlogMiddleware` (`app/logs/middleware.py:17-24` which captures context like IP).
* **Test Method/Action:**
    1.  Make a successful API call using a valid key with the required scope from IP_ADDRESS_1.
    2.  (If feasible to change source IP) Make the exact same API call using the same valid key and scope, but from a significantly different IP_ADDRESS_2 shortly after.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. A valid API key with a specific scope (e.g., `models:inference`). Ability to make requests from different source IPs.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Current state as per risk analysis) Both requests should succeed. The API's authorization logic currently relies on static scopes and does not incorporate dynamic context like source IP, request patterns, or time of day for allow/deny decisions. This test confirms this behavior.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Call 1 (from IP_ADDRESS_1) to `/api/v1/chat/completions` (with appropriate scope) succeeds (HTTP 200).
    2.  Call 2 (from IP_ADDRESS_2) to `/api/v1/chat/completions` (with same key/scope) also succeeds (HTTP 200).
    3.  Server logs show requests from different IPs but otherwise processed similarly.

### **ZTA_CAAC_002**
* **ID:** ZTA_CAAC_002
* **Category Ref:** Context-Aware Access Control
* **Description:** Verify absence of behavioral analysis influencing access decisions.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Authorization logic, API key model (`app/auth/models.py:25` `last_used_at`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Make a rapid series of valid API calls (e.g., 5 calls in 1 second) using the same API key. Then make another valid call.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. A valid API key with appropriate scope.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Current state) All calls should succeed (assuming no external rate limits from providers are hit). The API does not currently implement behavioral analysis to detect unusual access patterns (like rapid calls) from a key and then alter its trust level or access rights. `last_used_at` is tracked but not used for adaptive control.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  All calls in the rapid series succeed (HTTP 200).
    2.  The subsequent call also succeeds.
    3.  There is no indication in logs or API response that the trust level for the key was diminished due to the rapid calls.

### **ZTA_CAAC_003**
* **ID:** ZTA_CAAC_003
* **Category Ref:** Context-Aware Access Control
* **Description:** Verify authorization provides binary allow/deny without adaptive trust levels.
* **Exposure Point(s):** `valid_api_key` and `RequiresScope` dependencies.
* **Test Method/Action:**
    1.  Call an endpoint with a valid key and correct scope.
    2.  Call the same endpoint with a valid key but incorrect scope.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Current state) The first call results in HTTP 200. The second call results in HTTP 401. There are no intermediate trust levels or degraded functionality offered; access is either fully granted or fully denied based on authentication and static scope check.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Confirm HTTP 200 for the valid scoped request.
    2.  Confirm HTTP 401 (`{"detail": "Not Authorized"}`) for the invalid scoped request.

### **ZTA_CAAC_004**
* **ID:** ZTA_CAAC_004
* **Category Ref:** Context-Aware Access Control
* **Description:** Confirm that rich request context captured in logs is not used for authorization decisions.
* **Exposure Point(s):** `StructlogMiddleware` (`app/logs/middleware.py:17-24` captures `client_ip`, `user_agent`), `RequiresScope` (`app/auth/dependencies.py`).
* **Test Method/Action:** This is a review of the authorization logic in conjunction with ZTA_CAAC_001.
* **Prerequisites:** Access to source code.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Current state) The `RequiresScope` dependency and `valid_api_key` dependency base their decisions solely on the API key's properties (validity, active status, expiration, scopes) and do not consult other request context elements like `client_ip` or `user_agent` logged by the middleware.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Review the code for `valid_api_key` and `RequiresScope`.
    2.  Confirm that these functions do not access or use `request.state.client_ip`, `request.state.user_agent`, or other dynamic request attributes for making their allow/deny decisions.
    3.  This test verifies the "Limited Context Utilization" gap noted in the risk analysis.
