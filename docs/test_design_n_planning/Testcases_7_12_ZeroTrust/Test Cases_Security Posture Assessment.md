# Test Cases for Zero Trust: Security Posture Assessment

This document outlines test cases related to the Security Posture Assessment of the GSAi API Framework, based on Zero Trust testing strategies detailed in Section 7.12 of the TestPlan.md.

**Test Cases Summary: 14 (Original: 6, Enhanced: +8)**

**Referenced Code Components:**
* **Authentication Controls:** app/auth/dependencies.py:16-66 implements comprehensive authentication and authorization
* **Logging Infrastructure:** app/logs/middleware.py:11-47 provides security event capture and monitoring foundation
* **Input Validation:** Pydantic schemas and app/providers/utils.py provide data validation controls
* **Missing Assessment Framework:** No systematic evaluation of Zero Trust control effectiveness or maturity measurement
* **No Control Testing:** Missing automated validation of security control effectiveness and compliance
* **Integration Gaps:** Missing coordination between application-level security controls and infrastructure security measures

### **ZTA_SPA_001**
* **ID:** ZTA_SPA_001
* **Category Ref:** Security Posture Assessment
* **Description:** Verify effectiveness of authentication controls as a foundational element of security posture.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Authentication mechanisms (`app/auth/dependencies.py:16-66`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Execute a subset of authentication tests (e.g., no key, invalid key, expired key, inactive key - reusing ZTA_AUTH_001, ZTA_AUTH_003, ZTA_AUTH_004, ZTA_AUTH_005).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Fundamental authentication controls are in place and effectively prevent unauthorized access based on key validity. This confirms a baseline security posture.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Requests with missing/invalid/expired/inactive keys are rejected with 401.
    2.  This re-verifies core auth controls are active.

### **ZTA_SPA_002**
* **ID:** ZTA_SPA_002
* **Category Ref:** Security Posture Assessment
* **Description:** Verify effectiveness of authorization controls (scopes) as a foundational element.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Authorization mechanisms (`app/auth/dependencies.py:16-66`, specifically `RequiresScope`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Execute a subset of scope-based authorization tests (e.g., key with inference scope trying to access embedding endpoint - reusing ZTA_LP_001).
* **Prerequisites:** API running, API keys with specific scopes.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Fundamental authorization controls (scope checking) are in place and effectively prevent access to functionalities beyond the key's granted permissions.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Request to `/api/v1/embeddings` with a key only having `models:inference` scope is rejected with 401 ("Not Authorized").
    2.  This re-verifies core authZ controls.

### **ZTA_SPA_003**
* **ID:** ZTA_SPA_003
* **Category Ref:** Security Posture Assessment
* **Description:** Verify logging infrastructure provides a foundation for security event capture.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Logging mechanisms (`app/logs/middleware.py:11-47`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Make an API call and check if basic request metadata (ID, source IP, endpoint, status) is logged (reusing parts of ZTA_CM_001).
* **Prerequisites:** API running, logging configured.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Basic logging infrastructure is in place to capture security-relevant event metadata, forming a basis for monitoring and future posture assessment.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Successful API call generates logs containing `request_id`, `client_ip`, `method`, `path`, `status_code`.

### **ZTA_SPA_004**
* **ID:** ZTA_SPA_004
* **Category Ref:** Security Posture Assessment
* **Description:** Verify input validation controls (Pydantic) provide a layer of defense.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Pydantic schemas, FastAPI request validation.
* **Test Method/Action:** Send a request with clearly invalid input for a required field (e.g., wrong data type for `temperature` in chat completions - reusing parts of ZTA_DESIGN_003).
* **Prerequisites:** API running, valid API key.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Basic input validation controls are active and reject malformed requests before they reach deeper application logic.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Request with `temperature: "warm"` (string instead of float) to `/api/v1/chat/completions` is rejected with 422.

### **ZTA_SPA_005**
* **ID:** ZTA_SPA_005
* **Category Ref:** Security Posture Assessment
* **Description:** Assess absence of a systematic Zero Trust maturity measurement framework (Confirms Gap).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Overall project documentation, security processes. Risk analysis notes "Missing Assessment Framework," "No Maturity Measurement."
* **Test Method/Action:** Review project documentation and inquire about processes for measuring Zero Trust maturity or control effectiveness.
* **Prerequisites:** N/A
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Current state) No formal framework or defined metrics are in place for systematically assessing and tracking the maturity of Zero Trust implementation. This test confirms this gap.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Check for documents defining Zero Trust maturity levels, metrics, or assessment schedules for this specific API.
    2.  Absence of these confirms the gap.

### **ZTA_SPA_006**
* **ID:** ZTA_SPA_006
* **Category Ref:** Security Posture Assessment
* **Description:** Assess lack of automated validation of security control effectiveness (Confirms Gap).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Testing practices, CI/CD pipeline. Risk analysis notes "No Control Testing," "Control Validation Gaps."
* **Test Method/Action:** Review existing automated test suites (unit, integration tests) for specific tests that continuously validate security control configurations and effectiveness (e.g., tests that ensure auth cannot be bypassed, scopes are always checked).
* **Prerequisites:** Access to test suites.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Current state) While individual security features might be unit/integration tested, there may not be a dedicated suite of automated tests specifically designed to continuously validate the *effectiveness* of all critical Zero Trust security controls under various conditions, or to check for regressions in security configurations. This test aims to identify this gap.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Review test files (e.g., in `tests/`) for tests that explicitly target security control configurations (e.g., ensuring default CORS is not permissive in prod builds, IAM policies for assumed roles are minimal).
    2.  Identify if there are security-focused integration tests that run regularly to confirm controls haven't been misconfigured or bypassed by new code.
