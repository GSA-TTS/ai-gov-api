# Test Cases for Zero Trust: Maturity Assessment & Multi-Layer Defense

This document outlines test cases for verifying Zero Trust Maturity and Multi-Layer Defense Validation for the GSAi API Framework, based on Zero Trust testing strategies detailed in Section 7.12 of the TestPlan.md.

**Test Cases Summary: 14 (Original: 6, Enhanced: +8)**

**Referenced Code Components:**
* **Authentication Layer:** app/auth/dependencies.py:16-66 first line of defense with API key validation and scope checking
* **Input Validation Layer:** Pydantic schemas and app/providers/utils.py providing data validation and sanitization
* **Authorization Layer:** RequiresScope implementation ensuring granular permission enforcement
* **Logging and Monitoring:** app/logs/middleware.py:11-47 providing comprehensive audit trail and security event capture
* **Network Layer:** docker-compose.yml:37-38 basic network isolation between services
* **Infrastructure Dependencies:** External load balancers, WAFs, IAM roles, and LLM provider security
* **Integration Gaps:** Missing coordination between application-level security controls and infrastructure security measures

### **ZTA_MMD_001**
* **ID:** ZTA_MMD_001
* **Category Ref:** Zero Trust Maturity Assessment & Multi-Layer Defense Validation
* **Description:** Test defense-in-depth by attempting to bypass authentication to reach authorization.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Authentication layer (`app/auth/dependencies.py:16-45`), Authorization layer (`app/auth/dependencies.py:48-66`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Attempt to make a request to a scope-protected endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/chat/completions`) by:
    1.  Omitting the API key entirely.
    2.  Providing a syntactically valid but non-existent API key.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** The request is blocked by the authentication layer before the authorization (scope check) logic is even reached if no valid identity can be established. This demonstrates that layers are effective independently.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  For both attempts, verify a 401 Unauthorized error related to authentication (e.g., "Not authenticated", "Missing or invalid API key").
    2.  Ensure the error is not an authorization error (e.g., "Not Authorized" due to scope), indicating the authN layer failed first.
    3.  Server logs should confirm authentication failure, not authorization failure.

### **ZTA_MMD_002**
* **ID:** ZTA_MMD_002
* **Category Ref:** Zero Trust Maturity Assessment & Multi-Layer Defense Validation
* **Description:** Test defense-in-depth by attempting to bypass Pydantic input validation to reach backend logic with malformed data.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Input validation layer (Pydantic schemas), provider adapter logic (`app/providers/*/adapter_from_core.py`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Send a request to `/api/v1/chat/completions` with a structurally invalid payload that should be caught by Pydantic (e.g., `temperature` as a string, missing `messages` field).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Valid API key with correct scope.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** The request is blocked by the Pydantic input validation layer, returning a 422 error. The malformed data does not reach the core application logic or provider adapters.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Verify a 422 Unprocessable Entity error is returned.
    2.  Verify the response body details the Pydantic validation error.
    3.  Ensure no errors or unexpected behavior occur in deeper application layers or LLM provider calls (i.e., the request shouldn't get that far).

### **ZTA_MMD_003**
* **ID:** ZTA_MMD_003
* **Category Ref:** Zero Trust Maturity Assessment & Multi-Layer Defense Validation
* **Description:** Simulate failure/bypass of one control (e.g., WAF if present, conceptual) and test effectiveness of subsequent controls.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Overall architecture, multiple security layers (e.g., WAF, API AuthN/AuthZ, Input Validation).
* **Test Method/Action:** This is often a scenario-based test. Example:
    * Assume a WAF (if deployed) is intended to block basic XSS payloads.
    * Craft an XSS payload that *might* bypass a hypothetical WAF (e.g., using encoding or less common vectors).
    * Send this payload in a valid field (e.g., `messages[].content`) to the API.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Valid API key. (Actual WAF bypass is out of scope for app testing, this is about app's own handling).
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Even if a perimeter defense like a WAF was (hypothetically) bypassed, the API's own input handling and output encoding should prevent XSS. The API's Pydantic validation should still function for structure, and its JSON response encoding should neutralize XSS in outputs.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  The API should process the request (if payload is valid for field type).
    2.  The JSON response from the API must have the XSS payload correctly JSON-encoded (e.g., `<` becomes `\u003c`).
    3.  No active XSS should be possible if the JSON response is rendered by a typical client.
    4.  This tests the application's resilience even if an outer layer is weak.

### **ZTA_MMD_004**
* **ID:** ZTA_MMD_004
* **Category Ref:** Zero Trust Maturity Assessment & Multi-Layer Defense Validation
* **Description:** Verify logging and monitoring provides cross-layer visibility.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Logging from `StructlogMiddleware` (`app/logs/middleware.py`), auth dependencies, provider adapters.
* **Test Method/Action:** Trigger a multi-step scenario:
    1.  Successful authentication.
    2.  Successful scope authorization.
    3.  Successful Pydantic validation.
    4.  Successful call to an LLM provider.
    Inspect logs for entries from different layers, all correlatable via `request_id`.
* **Prerequisites:** API running, logging configured.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Logs from different stages of request processing (authentication, authorization, request parsing, provider interaction, response generation) can be correlated using a common identifier (e.g., `request_id`), providing an end-to-end view for security event correlation.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Make a successful API call (e.g., to `/api/v1/chat/completions`).
    2.  Note the `request_id` from the logs (or a response header if configured).
    3.  Search/filter logs for this `request_id`.
    4.  Confirm log entries showing:
        * Initial request details (IP, path, method from middleware).
        * API key ID used for authentication (from `valid_api_key` or middleware context).
        * Metrics/details of LLM provider interaction (from provider backend code).
        * Billing event.
        * Final response status and duration (from middleware).

### **ZTA_MMD_005**
* **ID:** ZTA_MMD_005
* **Category Ref:** Zero Trust Maturity Assessment & Multi-Layer Defense Validation
* **Description:** Assess breach containment capabilities based on current network isolation (Basic).
* **Exposure Point(s):** `docker-compose.yml` network configuration. Risk analysis notes "Containment Limitations: Basic network isolation exists but lacks advanced breach containment or lateral movement prevention."
* **Test Method/Action:** This is a review of the `docker-compose.yml` and conceptual analysis.
* **Prerequisites:** Access to `docker-compose.yml`.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Current state) The `docker-compose.yml` provides network namespace isolation between the API container and the database container via the `backend-network`. This provides a basic level of containment: if the API container were compromised, the attacker would not automatically have direct network access to other hosts outside this Docker network, but could access the database *within* that network. Advanced containment (e.g., stricter rules on the Docker network, host-level firewalls) is noted as a gap.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Confirm the API and DB services are on a shared, isolated Docker network (e.g., `backend-network`).
    2.  Recognize that if the API container is compromised, the database on this network is a primary target.
    3.  This test verifies the "basic network isolation" and implicitly the "lacks advanced breach containment" part of the risk analysis.

### **ZTA_MMD_006**
* **ID:** ZTA_MMD_006
* **Category Ref:** Zero Trust Maturity Assessment & Multi-Layer Defense Validation
* **Description:** Assess integration gaps between application-level security and infrastructure security.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Overall security architecture, including application controls and external controls (WAF, IAM, network firewalls). Risk analysis notes "Integration Gaps: Missing coordination between application-level security controls and infrastructure security measures."
* **Test Method/Action:** This is a strategic review and gap analysis. Consider scenarios where lack of coordination could be an issue. For example, if application logs detect repeated auth failures from an IP, is there any mechanism to feed this to a WAF or firewall to block that IP?
* **Prerequisites:** Understanding of both application security features and deployed infrastructure security measures.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Ideal state) Application-level security events (e.g., high rate of auth failures, specific types of malformed requests indicative of attack) can trigger or inform infrastructure-level defenses (e.g., adaptive firewall rules, WAF blocking). (Current state) This coordination is likely missing.
* **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Review if any mechanisms exist for the application to signal threat intelligence to infrastructure components (e.g., via specific log formats consumed by a SIEM that then actions firewall rules).
    2.  Confirm the "Integration Gaps" statement from the risk analysis by identifying the lack of such automated coordination.
