# **Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.3: Security Testing**

## **0\. Introduction**

This document outlines the potential risk surfaces of the GSAi API Framework relevant to the security testing strategies detailed in Section 7.3 of the TestPlan.md. The analysis focuses on AI/LLM-specific vulnerabilities and how different components of the system could be targeted or might expose sensitive information or functionalities.  

The goal is to identify areas requiring rigorous security testing to ensure the API's resilience against common and AI-specific threats.

## **1\. Risk Surfaces Relevant to 7.3.1 OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) Testing**

While the OWASP API Security Top 10 provides a general framework for API security, several items have particular relevance in the context of an LLM-proxying API. We will focus on how these vulnerabilities might manifest with an AI/LLM dimension.

### **API1:2023 \- Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * User-specific resources (hypothetical, as current API doesn't have many, but consider future state e.g. chat history).  
  * API Key Management (app/routers/tokens.py \- though admin-only, BOLA could apply if agency admins manage their own keys).  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API1  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** If LLM interactions (e.g., chat sessions, fine-tuned models, usage data) are tied to specific users or agencies, BOLA could allow one user/agency to access another's LLM-related data or functionalities.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: Request with an identifier for an LLM-related resource (e.g., session ID, model ID).  
  * Processing: API checks if the authenticated user (via API Key manager\_id) has rights to the resource.  
  * Output: LLM-related data or action.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * Accessing another agency's chat history (which might contain sensitive prompts/outputs).  
  * Using/managing another agency's quota for LLM calls.  
  * Accessing another agency's custom fine-tuned models (if this feature were added).  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/auth/dependencies.py: get\_current\_active\_user\_with\_api\_key authenticates the key. Authorization logic for specific resources would depend on how api\_key.manager\_id is used to scope data access.  
  * app/auth/repositories.py: APIKeyRepository handles secure API key lookups with hash-based comparison.  
  * app/users/models.py: User model provides multi-tenant foundation for future object-level authorization.  
  * app/services/billing.py: Usage data associated with manager\_id provides object-level separation for billing data.  
  * Currently, the main LLM endpoints (/chat/completions, /embeddings) do not seem to have strong user-specific object-level distinctions beyond the API key itself determining access to the general service. Billing data is associated with manager\_id.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** An agency/user cannot access or manipulate LLM resources or data (including prompts, responses, usage) belonging to another agency/user.  
* **Cross-references:** 7\_3\_DataExposure.md (Section 2.E on Database Storage, 2.A on API Responses).

### **API2:2023 \- Broken Authentication**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * API Key Validation Logic (app/auth/dependencies.py, app/auth/repositories.py).  
  * Token Endpoint (/api/v1/auth/token in app/routers/tokens.py \- though this is for user login to get a JWT for *managing* API keys, not for LLM calls directly).  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API2  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Compromised authentication allows unauthorized access to LLM functionalities, potentially leading to misuse of LLM resources, data exfiltration via LLM, or injection of malicious prompts.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: API Key in Authorization header.  
  * Processing: Validation of key's existence, status, expiry, and hash.  
  * Output: Access granted/denied to LLM proxy services.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * Unauthorized use of LLM models, incurring costs or exhausting quotas.  
  * Ability to submit prompts to LLMs under a compromised identity, potentially accessing context or data the LLM might have associated with that identity (if stateful).  
  * **Authentication Bypass Techniques:**  
    * Missing Authorization header exploitation  
    * Malformed Bearer token parsing vulnerabilities  
    * API key reuse after expiration or revocation  
    * Hash collision attacks against SHA-256 implementation  
    * Timing attacks against key validation logic  
  * **Session Security Issues:**  
    * Concurrent session handling vulnerabilities  
    * API key scope escalation through manipulation  
    * Cross-agency authentication token confusion  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/auth/utils.py: verify\_api\_key\_hash, generate\_api\_key\_hash. Uses SHA256 with secrets.token\_urlsafe() for secure generation.  
  * app/auth/repositories.py: APIKeyRepository.get\_by\_api\_key\_value performs hashing before lookup.  
  * app/auth/dependencies.py: Checks for key status (is\_active) and expiry (expires\_at).  
  * app/routers/tokens.py: Admin-only API key management with proper scope validation.  
  * app/db/session.py: Async database session management affects auth lookup security.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** Only valid, active, and authorized API keys can access LLM functionalities.  
* **Cross-references:** 7\_3\_DataExposure.md (Section 2.E on APIKey model).

### **API3:2023 \- Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA) / Excessive Data Exposure**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * API Responses from /api/v1/models, /api/v1/chat/completions, /api/v1/embeddings.  
  * Error messages from all endpoints.  
  * Log entries (app/logs/middleware.py, app/services/billing.py).  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API3  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** API responses or error messages related to LLM interactions might expose more information than necessary (e.g., internal provider details, full prompts in errors, sensitive model configurations). Logs might capture sensitive prompt/response data.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: User prompt, model parameters.  
  * Processing: Interaction with LLM provider, error handling.  
  * Output: API response (LLM output, usage data), error messages, server logs.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * /models endpoint exposing internal LLM provider ARNs or specific backend configurations not relevant to the end-user.  
  * Error messages from LLM interactions revealing too much about the provider's error or internal state.  
  * Logging full prompts and responses containing PII or sensitive business data at inappropriate log levels (e.g., INFO in production).  
  * LLM responses themselves containing sensitive data (if the LLM was compromised or misused).  
  * **API Response Data Exposure:**  
    * Provider-specific error details leaked through adapter transformations  
    * Internal model configurations exposed in response metadata  
    * Database session information exposed in error responses  
    * API key details inadvertently included in responses  
  * **Logging Security Issues:**  
    * Request correlation IDs exposing cross-agency relationships  
    * Middleware logging exposing sensitive request/response headers  
    * Billing service logs containing more usage data than necessary  
    * Log aggregation potentially exposing cross-tenant information  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/providers/base.py: LLMModel schema for /models is restricted.  
  * app/main.py: json\_500\_handler provides generic 500 errors, CORS configuration affects headers.  
  * app/logs/middleware.py: Does not log request/response bodies by default.  
  * app/logs/logging\_config.py: PIIFilteringProcessor aims to redact PII.  
  * app/logs/logging\_context.py: Request context management affects data exposure.  
  * app/common/exceptions.py: Repository-level exception handling.  
  * Provider adapters (app/providers/\*/adapter\_to\_core.py): Critical for response data filtering.  
  * 7\_3\_DataExposure.md provides extensive analysis of this for each endpoint and logging mechanism.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** API responses and logs only contain necessary information. Sensitive data from prompts/responses is not unduly exposed in errors or logs. Internal LLM provider details are abstracted.  
* **Cross-references:** 7\_3\_DataExposure.md (Sections 2.A, 2.B, 2.C).

### **API4:2023 \- Unrestricted Resource Consumption**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * /api/v1/chat/completions endpoint (especially with max\_tokens, complex prompts, streaming).  
  * /api/v1/embeddings endpoint (especially with large inputs or many inputs in a batch).  
  * Underlying LLM provider resources.  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API4  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Malicious or poorly formed requests could lead to excessive consumption of LLM provider resources (computation, tokens), leading to financial impact or denial of service for other users.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: User prompts (potentially very long or complex), max\_tokens, batch inputs for embeddings.  
  * Processing: API forwards request to LLM provider.  
  * Output: LLM response or error.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * No rate limiting on API calls, allowing rapid, repeated calls to expensive LLM operations.  
  * No limits on input size (prompt length, number of messages, embedding input size/count) before passing to LLM, potentially hitting provider limits abruptly or causing excessive processing.  
  * Abuse of streaming requests to keep connections open.  
  * Exploiting models with large context windows to submit resource-intensive requests.  
  * **Provider-Specific Resource Attacks:**  
    * Bedrock-specific rate limiting bypass through model switching  
    * Vertex AI quota exhaustion through batched requests  
    * Provider connection pool exhaustion through concurrent requests  
    * Streaming response manipulation to consume server resources  
  * **Database Resource Consumption:**  
    * Excessive API key validation queries during brute force attacks  
    * Billing data accumulation causing database performance issues  
    * Session management resource exhaustion during concurrent auth requests  
  * **Memory and CPU Attacks:**  
    * Large JSON payloads causing parsing overhead  
    * Complex nested request structures overwhelming validation  
    * Concurrent request processing overwhelming server resources  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * The application itself does not appear to implement explicit rate limiting or input size limits beyond Pydantic schema validation and web server limits (e.g., Uvicorn's). It relies on downstream LLM providers for their own limits.  
  * app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py: Some fields like max\_tokens can be set by the user.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** The API should have mechanisms (or rely on clearly documented provider mechanisms passed through) to prevent resource exhaustion, such as rate limits, input size validation, and potentially quotas per API key.  
* **Cross-references:** TestPlan.md section 5.9.6 (Rate Limiting & Throttling).

### **API5:2023 \- Broken Function Level Authorization**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * Distinction between general model inference endpoints and potential future administrative/privileged LLM-related functions (e.g., model fine-tuning, detailed usage reporting for specific agencies).  
  * app/auth/dependencies.py: requires\_scope decorator.  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API5  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** A user with access to basic LLM inference might try to access privileged LLM-related functions if scopes or function-level checks are not properly enforced.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: API request to a specific endpoint.  
  * Processing: requires\_scope checks if the API key has the necessary scope for the function.  
  * Output: Access to LLM function or 403 Forbidden.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * A user with models:inference scope attempting to access a hypothetical models:fine-tune function.  
  * Accessing detailed billing/token consumption data meant for administrators.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * Scopes like models:inference, models:embedding, admin:manage:keys are defined in app/auth/schemas.py.  
  * app/routers/api\_v1.py uses requires\_scope for /chat/completions and /embeddings.  
  * app/routers/tokens.py uses admin:manage:keys for token management.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** Users can only access LLM-related functionalities (inference, management, etc.) for which their API key is explicitly scoped.

### **API6:2023 \- Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows (AI/LLM Context)**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * /api/v1/chat/completions and /api/v1/embeddings endpoints.  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API6  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** While not "sensitive business flows" in the traditional e-commerce sense, the core functionality of interacting with LLMs *is* the business flow. Unrestricted access can lead to abuse patterns that are not simple DoS but rather strategic exploitation.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Model Scraping/Inference:** Automated, rapid querying of models to reverse-engineer behavior, extract training data patterns, or build a derivative model.  
  * **Data Exfiltration via Prompts:** Using the LLM as an oracle to extract sensitive information it might have been inadvertently exposed to (e.g., if a system prompt contained sensitive data, or if used in a RAG system with overly broad access).  
  * **Generating Harmful Content at Scale:** Using the API to generate large volumes of spam, phishing emails, disinformation, or other malicious content.  
  * **Competitive Cost Incurrence:** An authorized but malicious actor driving up costs for a competitor by making legitimate but excessive calls if quotas are shared or not granular enough.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * The API primarily acts as a proxy. Defenses against these would largely rely on robust monitoring, anomaly detection, and potentially more sophisticated rate limiting or content filtering capabilities (which may be out of scope for the framework itself but important for the overall service).  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** While the API framework might not implement all defenses directly, it should be designed to support such measures (e.g., by providing detailed logs for anomaly detection). Clear policies and potentially advanced request throttling might be needed at a higher level.

### **API7:2023 \- Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * ImageContentPart.image\_url.url in app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py if it were ever changed to accept arbitrary URLs instead of just data: URIs.  
  * Any future feature that involves the API fetching data from a user-supplied URL to provide context to an LLM.  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API7  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** If the API fetches content from a URL provided by the user (e.g., to give an image URL to an LLM that can process external images, or a document URL for RAG), a malicious URL could target internal services or cloud metadata endpoints.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: User provides a URL in the prompt or request.  
  * Processing: API server attempts to fetch content from this URL.  
  * Output: Content from URL is processed or fed to LLM.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * Attacker makes the API request resources from internal network addresses.  
  * Attacker probes cloud provider metadata services (e.g., 169.254.169.254).  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/providers/utils.py (parse\_data\_uri): Currently, this function *only* processes data:image/...;base64,... URIs. It explicitly checks for this prefix and raises an error otherwise. This is a strong defense against SSRF for image inputs.  
  * The API does not currently have features that fetch from arbitrary user-supplied HTTP(S) URLs.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** The API must not fetch resources from arbitrary user-supplied URLs. If such a feature is added, it must use strict allowlists for domains, disallow internal IPs, and have other SSRF mitigations. Current implementation for images is secure against this.

### **API8:2023 \- Security Misconfiguration**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * Application server configuration (Uvicorn/FastAPI settings).  
  * Operating system and container configurations.  
  * Cloud provider configurations (IAM roles, security groups for Bedrock/Vertex AI access).  
  * app/config/settings.py: Application-level settings, including log levels, backend model mappings.  
  * Error handling verbosity (app/main.py).  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API8  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Misconfigurations could expose sensitive information about the LLM backends, allow unnecessary features, or lead to insecure logging of LLM interactions.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * Verbose error messages (e.g., from LLM provider SDKs) being passed directly to the client, revealing internal provider details or stack traces.  
  * Default credentials used for accessing LLM provider services.  
  * Overly permissive IAM roles for accessing Bedrock/Vertex AI, allowing the API framework more access than needed (e.g., to manage models when it only needs to invoke).  
  * Debug mode enabled in production, potentially leaking sensitive info.  
  * Incorrect log level settings in production (e.g., DEBUG) leading to excessive logging of sensitive prompt/response data.
  * **Enhanced ValidationError Exposure:** The new global ValidationError exception handler (app/main.py) could expose too much validation detail, revealing internal schema information, file paths, or system configuration details.
  * **File Handling Configuration Gaps:** Inconsistent file handling configurations between providers could create security gaps or expose different levels of system information through error messages.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/main.py: json\_500\_handler aims to provide generic errors.  
  * app/config/settings.py: LOG\_LEVEL is configurable. Backend mappings are defined here.  
  * Secrets (provider keys, DB connection) are loaded from environment variables.  
  * 7\_3\_DataExposure.md (Section 2.D) discusses configuration secrets.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** Secure configurations at all levels, least privilege access to LLM providers, non-verbose errors, appropriate log levels in production.

### **API9:2023 \- Improper Inventory Management**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * All API endpoints (/api/v1/models, /chat/completions, /embeddings, /auth/token, /users/me).  
  * Documentation (/openapi.json).  
  * Older or deprecated API versions (if applicable in the future).  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API9  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Undocumented or old/unpatched API endpoints that interact with LLMs could pose security risks. Lack of clarity on which models are supported, their capabilities, or data handling policies.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * A "shadow" or "debug" LLM endpoint that bypasses standard authentication/authorization or logging.  
  * Outdated model IDs in the /models list that point to vulnerable or non-existent backends.  
  * Lack of clear documentation on data retention or PII handling for prompts/responses sent to different LLMs.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * app/main.py defines the included routers.  
  * app/routers/api\_v1.py defines the current v1 LLM endpoints.  
  * app/config/settings.py (backend\_map) defines the available models.  
  * FastAPI generates /openapi.json from code and Pydantic models.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** All LLM-interacting endpoints are properly documented, secured, and monitored. Model inventory is accurate. Data handling policies for LLM interactions are clear.

### **API10:2023 \- Unsafe Consumption of APIs (Downstream LLMs)**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * Code interacting with Bedrock SDK (app/providers/bedrock/bedrock.py).  
  * Code interacting with Vertex AI SDK (app/providers/vertex\_ai/vertexai.py).  
  * Error handling for responses from these downstream LLM APIs.  
  * Data validation of responses received from LLMs.  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.1.API10  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** The API framework itself consumes APIs from Bedrock and Vertex AI. If it doesn't handle their responses securely (e.g., trusts them implicitly, fails to validate, or mishandles errors), it can lead to vulnerabilities.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * Not validating or sanitizing responses from LLMs, potentially passing on malicious content generated by a compromised or erroneous LLM (e.g., if an LLM generated a script or harmful link and the API just passed it through).  
  * Improperly handling error codes or unexpected response structures from LLM providers, leading to crashes or information leakage in the API framework's own error messages.  
  * Insufficient timeout handling for calls to LLM providers, leading to resource exhaustion in the API framework.  
  * Trusting that data from an LLM provider is always safe, without considering if the LLM itself could be a source of malicious output.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * Adapter modules (app/providers/\*/adapter\_to\_core.py) transform provider responses into the API's core schema. This is a point where validation or sanitization of LLM output could occur.  
  * Provider interaction logic in bedrock.py and vertexai.py handles SDK calls and initial error catching.  
  * app/main.py's global error handler catches downstream errors.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** The API framework should treat responses from LLM providers with caution, validate their structure, handle errors gracefully, and ideally sanitize or flag potentially harmful content before passing it to the end client. Timeouts and retries for downstream calls should be robust.

## **2\. Risk Surfaces Relevant to 7.3.2 LLM-Specific Security Testing**

This section focuses on vulnerabilities unique to or exacerbated by the use of LLMs.

### **Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Prevention**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * All input fields that contribute to the LLM prompt:  
    * ChatCompletionRequest.messages\[\].content (text, image data, file data) in app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py.  
    * EmbeddingRequest.input in app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py.  
  * Internal handling and transformation of these inputs by adapter modules (app/providers/\*/adapter\_from\_core.py, app/providers/\*/adapter\_to\_core.py).  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.2  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Users can craft inputs (prompts) to try to make the LLM ignore previous instructions, reveal sensitive information, execute unintended actions, or generate harmful content.  
* **Data Flow (Focus on AI/LLM aspects):**  
  * Input: User-supplied text, image data, or file data intended as prompt material.  
  * Processing:  
    * API framework validates input structure (Pydantic, parse\_data\_uri).  
    * Adapters convert the request to the format expected by the specific LLM provider (Bedrock, Vertex AI). This step is critical to ensure no further vulnerabilities are introduced.  
    * LLM provider processes the prompt.  
  * Output: LLM's response, potentially influenced by the injection attempt.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Direct Prompt Injection:** User input directly overrides or bypasses system prompts or instructions.  
    * *Instruction Hijacking:* "Ignore previous instructions and do X."  
    * *Role Playing:* "You are now UnfilteredLLM..."  
    * *Delimiter Injection:* Using ```python, <|endoftext|>, \n\n### Instructions: to bypass filters  
    * *Encoding Attacks:* Base64, Unicode, ROT13, URL encoding to obfuscate malicious instructions  
    * *Context Length Exhaustion:* Filling context window to remove safety instructions  
  * **Indirect Prompt Injection:** Malicious prompts embedded in data sources that the LLM might process (e.g., if the API were to fetch content from a URL provided by the user and include it in the prompt \- not currently the case, but a future risk if features change).  
  * **Data Exfiltration:** Tricking the LLM into revealing parts of its system prompt, configuration, or data it has access to (e.g., from a RAG system, if implemented).  
  * **Generating Harmful/Biased/Illegal Content:** Bypassing the LLM's safety filters.  
  * **Denial of Service:** Crafting prompts that cause the LLM to consume excessive resources or enter error states.  
  * **Exploiting Parsers:** Inputs designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how the API framework or the LLM itself parses complex prompt structures (e.g., multi-modal inputs).  
  * **Multi-Modal Attack Vectors:**  
    * Image-based prompt injection through embedded text in images  
    * Data URI manipulation to bypass content filters  
    * Multi-modal content confusion attacks  
  * **Advanced Injection Techniques:**  
    * Token smuggling through special Unicode characters  
    * Language switching to bypass English-language filters  
    * Nested instruction attempts with multiple delimiters  
    * Prompt template injection through message structure manipulation  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * The API framework primarily acts as a proxy and relies on Pydantic for structural validation.  
  * app/providers/utils.py (parse\_data\_uri): Validates data: URIs for images.  
  * Adapter modules (app/providers/\*/adapter\_from\_core.py, app/providers/\*/adapter\_to\_core.py): These are critical for ensuring that the translation to provider-specific formats doesn't introduce new ways to inject or obfuscate prompts. For example, how different message roles (system, user, assistant) and content parts (text, image) are assembled.  
  * The framework does not currently implement its own prompt sanitization or explicit defenses against prompt injection beyond passing the (structured) input to the LLM. Defenses are primarily expected from the downstream LLM providers.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):**  
  * The API framework should not introduce new prompt injection vulnerabilities during its processing or adaptation of user inputs.  
  * It should faithfully transmit the user's structured input to the LLM provider in a way that allows the provider's own defenses to operate effectively.  
  * The API should handle errors from the LLM provider (e.g., if the provider detects and blocks a malicious prompt) gracefully.  
* **Cross-references:** 7\_3\_InputValidation\_InjectionTesting.md (Section 2.B.4 LLM Prompt Injection).

### **Model Security Testing (Information Leakage, Manipulation)**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * LLM responses from /api/v1/chat/completions.  
  * Error messages that might inadvertently reveal model details.  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.2  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** Attackers might try to probe the LLM to understand its architecture, extract parts of its training data, or manipulate its confidence scores.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Training Data Extraction:** Prompts designed to make the LLM regurgitate verbatim or near-verbatim training data, potentially exposing PII or copyrighted material if present in the training set.  
  * **Model Architecture Probing:** Queries aimed at inferring details about the model's architecture, size, or specific algorithms used (less likely to succeed with modern closed models via a proxy).  
  * **Confidence Manipulation/Output Steering:** Inputs designed to make the model produce specific outputs with high confidence, even if incorrect or harmful.  
  * **Information Leakage via Error Messages:** If errors from the LLM provider are too verbose and passed through, they might reveal internal model names, versions, or configurations.  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * The API framework is a proxy; these attacks primarily target the downstream LLM.  
  * The framework's role is to not exacerbate these risks, e.g., by ensuring error messages are generic (app/main.py json\_500\_handler).  
  * Adapters (app/providers/\*/adapter\_to\_core.py) ensure that only expected parts of the LLM response are transformed and sent to the client.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** The API framework should not facilitate model security attacks. It should relay LLM responses but abstract away unnecessary provider-specific details, especially in errors. The primary defense lies with the LLM provider.

### **Cross-Agency Data Protection (Context Isolation, Data Leakage)**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:**  
  * All LLM interaction points (/chat/completions, /embeddings) if there's any shared state or context between different API keys (agencies).  
  * Logging (app/logs/middleware.py, app/services/billing.py).  
  * Database storage of API keys and user associations (app/auth/models.py).  
* **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.3.2  
* **Description of AI/LLM Interaction:** If the API or the underlying LLMs maintain any state or context based on the API key or user, there's a risk that one agency's data/prompts could leak into another agency's session or be logged in a way that violates separation.  
* **Potential AI/LLM Specific Exposures/Vulnerabilities:**  
  * **Context Contamination:** If an LLM session or cache is inadvertently shared between users/agencies, one agency might see responses influenced by another's prompts. (This API appears stateless per request, mitigating this for the LLM call itself, but caching layers or future stateful features could introduce this).  
  * **Log Leakage:** If logs are not properly segregated or if identifiers allow cross-referencing, one agency might infer another's activity or data.  
  * **Embedding Space Collisions (Highly Unlikely with Standard Models):** If custom embeddings were stored and not properly namespaced by agency, one agency might retrieve another's data. (Not applicable to current "generate embeddings" flow).  
* **Current Implementation Check (Code Pointers & Brief Analysis):**  
  * Each API request is authenticated independently via API key. LLM calls appear stateless from the framework's perspective for each request.  
  * app/logs/logging\_context.py uses request\_id for tracing. manager\_id (user UUID) is logged for billing. Access to logs is critical.  
  * PIIFilteringProcessor in app/logs/logging\_config.py attempts to filter PII.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome (from an AI/LLM perspective):** Strict data isolation between agencies for all LLM interactions, logs, and any stored metadata. No leakage of prompts, responses, or usage patterns from one agency to another.
