# **Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.9: Test Data Management Strategy**

This document outlines the potential risk surfaces of the GSAi API Framework related to the Test Data Management Strategy detailed in Section 7.9 of the TestPlan.md. The analysis focuses on how the creation, management, and utilization of test data can impact the quality, coverage, and reliability of testing, especially concerning AI/LLM interactions and outputs.  
Effective test data management is crucial for ensuring that functional, security, performance, and reliability tests yield meaningful results. For an AI-centric API, this includes managing diverse prompts, expected (or patterned) LLM responses, and data for various edge cases.

The goal is to identify areas where test data practices could introduce risks to the thoroughness or accuracy of the overall testing effort.

## **Data Generation**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Quality and Representativeness of Synthetic Test Data  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.9 (Data Generation)  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **API Key Generation:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py:19-49 for generating test API keys with specific manager\_id and scopes (MODELS\_INFERENCE, MODELS\_EMBEDDING, ADMIN)  
    * **Test Fixtures:** tests/unit/providers/conftest.py:15-75 provides core chat and embedding request/response fixtures for unit testing  
    * **Integration Test Data:** tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:27-279 includes synthetic PII placeholders and test scenarios  
    * **Manual Data Creation:** No evidence of structured synthetic data generation tools or libraries like Faker in current implementation  
    * **Parameterized Data:** Limited use of pytest.mark.parametrize found only in tests/unit/auth/test\_authorization.py:11-20 for scope combinations  
    * **Prompt Libraries:** Missing structured prompt library despite TestPlan.md references - no centralized prompt management found  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:  
    The primary strategy is using synthetic data. The risk lies in this data not adequately representing the variety, complexity, or edge cases of real-world LLM interactions.  
    * **Prompts:** Synthetic prompts might be too simplistic, not cover diverse topics, tones, lengths, or formats (e.g., multi-modal inputs like image data URIs, file data). This could miss functional bugs or performance issues specific to certain prompt types.  
    * **API Keys:** Test API keys generated by create\_admin\_user.py might not cover all relevant scope combinations or user roles if the system evolves more complex authorization.  
    * **Parameter Combinations:** Synthetic data might not cover enough combinations of LLM parameters (temperature, max\_tokens, model ID, stream flag, etc.), missing bugs related to specific interactions of these parameters.  
  * **Potential Issues if Test Data is Deficient:**  
    * Functional tests might pass with overly simple prompts but fail with more complex real-world inputs.  
    * Security tests for prompt injection might be ineffective if synthetic prompts don't include characteristics that could be exploited.  
    * Performance tests might not accurately reflect production load if synthetic prompts don't match typical complexity or length.  
    * Incomplete testing of authorization logic if test API keys don't represent diverse access scenarios.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **Missing Synthetic Data Framework:** No automated generation tools or utilities for creating diverse test scenarios  
    * **Limited Test Fixtures:** tests/unit/providers/conftest.py:15-75 provides basic fixtures but lacks comprehensive parameter variation  
    * **No Prompt Library:** Despite TestPlan.md requirements, no structured prompt library or categorized test prompts exist  
    * **Manual API Key Management:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py:22-71 requires manual execution, no automated test key generation  
    * **Insufficient Parameterization:** Only tests/unit/auth/test\_authorization.py:11-20 uses parametrize, missing systematic parameter coverage  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** Synthetic test data (prompts, API keys, request parameters) is diverse, representative of expected real-world use (including common, edge, and error-inducing cases), and systematically generated to cover a wide range of AI/LLM interaction scenarios. Test data generation processes are versioned and repeatable.

## **Data Anonymization/Masking**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Effectiveness of Data Anonymization (if production-derived data were ever used)  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.9 (Data Anonymization/Masking)  
  * **Referenced Document:** docs/test\_design\_n\_planning/7\_9\_DataAnonymization.md  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **PII Filtering Implementation:** Referenced PIIFilteringProcessor not found in app/logs/logging\_config.py:1-54 - no PII filtering mechanisms implemented  
    * **Logging Configuration:** app/logs/logging\_config.py:11-48 provides structured logging with JSON/console rendering but lacks PII redaction  
    * **Privacy Test Coverage:** tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:100-128 tests error message privacy but no systematic anonymization validation  
    * **Synthetic PII Handling:** tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:27-98 uses synthetic PII placeholders for testing but no anonymization tools  
    * **Data Masking Processes:** No automated anonymization or masking tools found in codebase despite TestPlan.md requirements  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:  
    Although the plan emphasizes synthetic data, if any real data snippets (e.g., for specific types of prompts or for testing PII handling by LLMs) were ever to be used in non-production environments, or if LLMs generate PII-like data during tests, the risk is that anonymization is incomplete.  
    * PII or sensitive agency information within test prompts or expected outputs could be exposed in test environments, test reports, or logs if not properly masked.  
    * The PIIFilteringProcessor's effectiveness in redacting PII from logs generated during test runs is a direct concern. If it fails, test logs could contain sensitive data from test inputs/outputs.  
  * **Potential Issues if Test Data is Deficient:**  
    * Accidental exposure of sensitive data in test environments or results.  
    * Compliance violations if PII is mishandled during testing.  
    * Test logs becoming a source of data leakage.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **Missing PIIFilteringProcessor:** Referenced in original analysis but not implemented in app/logs/logging\_config.py:1-54  
    * **No Automated PII Detection:** Lack of tools for automatic PII detection and redaction in test data or logs  
    * **Limited Privacy Testing:** tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:100-279 tests privacy scenarios but no validation of anonymization effectiveness  
    * **Manual Privacy Validation:** No automated scanning for sensitive data in test outputs or logs  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** Robust anonymization processes are in place for any non-synthetic data used in testing. The PIIFilteringProcessor effectively redacts PII from logs generated during test execution, ensuring test outputs do not contain sensitive information.

## **Data Parameterization**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Management and Coverage of Parameterized Test Data  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.9 (Data Parameterization)  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **Limited Parameterization Usage:** pytest.mark.parametrize found only in tests/unit/auth/test\_authorization.py:11-20 for scope validation testing  
    * **Test Fixtures:** tests/unit/providers/conftest.py:15-75 provides structured fixtures but lacks parameter variation coverage  
    * **Missing Data Files:** No CSV, JSON, or YAML test data files found for feeding parameterized tests  
    * **Configuration Coverage:** No systematic testing of all models from backend\_map configuration  
    * **Parameter Combinations:** Missing systematic coverage of LLM parameters (temperature, max\_tokens, top\_p, stream flags) in test suite  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:  
    Data-driven testing is essential for covering many variations of LLM API calls. The risk is that the parameter sets are not comprehensive enough or are poorly managed.  
    * **Model IDs:** Not testing against all supported models listed in app/config/settings.py (backend\_map) or TestPlan.md Section 3\.  
    * **LLM Parameters:** Insufficient variation in temperature, max\_tokens, top\_p, stream, stop sequences, presence\_penalty, frequency\_penalty.  
    * **Message Structures:** Not enough variation in messages array: role sequences (user, assistant, system), content types (text, image\_url, file), number of messages.  
    * **Embedding Inputs:** Insufficient variation in input (single string, list of strings, varying lengths) and dimensions for embedding requests.  
  * **Potential Issues if Test Data is Deficient:**  
    * Bugs specific to certain model IDs or parameter combinations might be missed.  
    * Incomplete testing of how different LLM providers (via model ID mapping) handle the same set of parameters.  
    * Functional or performance issues related to specific message structures (e.g., very long conversation histories, mixed content types) might not be found.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **Insufficient Parameterization:** Only 1 test file uses pytest.mark.parametrize despite TestPlan.md emphasis on data-driven testing  
    * **Missing Model Coverage:** No systematic testing across all backend\_map model configurations  
    * **Limited Parameter Testing:** tests/unit/providers/conftest.py:26-40 shows some parameters but lacks comprehensive variation  
    * **No External Data Sources:** Missing CSV/JSON/YAML files for feeding parameterized tests  
    * **Manual Parameter Management:** Test parameters hardcoded rather than systematically generated or managed  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** Parameterized tests use comprehensive and well-structured data sets covering a wide range of valid and invalid inputs for all LLM-relevant API parameters and model IDs, ensuring thorough testing of diverse interaction scenarios.

## **Data Isolation**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Test Data Interference in Shared Test Environments  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.9 (Data Isolation)  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **Test Environment Setup:** tests/conftest.py:1-6 provides basic project path configuration but lacks environment isolation  
    * **Database Models:** app/users/models.py and app/auth/models.py define user and API key schemas requiring isolation during testing  
    * **API Key Management:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py:22-71 creates keys with manager\_id but no test-specific isolation mechanisms  
    * **Test Configuration:** tests/integration/config.py provides test configuration but no evidence of data isolation patterns  
    * **Missing Teardown Logic:** No systematic setUp/tearDown patterns found in test suites for data cleanup  
    * **Billing Data Isolation:** app/services/billing.py:7-24 queue-based billing could interfere between tests without proper isolation  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:  
    If tests run concurrently or sequentially in a shared environment without proper data isolation, one test's data or state could affect another.  
    * **API Key State:** If tests modify the state of an API key (e.g., deactivate it, change its scopes) and that key is shared by other concurrent tests.  
    * **User Data:** If tests create or modify user data associated with API keys (manager\_id), this could interfere if not properly isolated per test.  
    * **Billing Data:** Test-generated billing records (app/services/billing.py) could accumulate and interfere with assertions if not cleared or isolated.  
    * **LLM Context (Hypothetical):** While the current API is stateless per request, if any future features involve server-side session context for LLMs tied to an API key, lack of isolation could lead to context bleeding between tests.  
  * **Potential Issues if Test Data is Deficient:**  
    * Flaky tests where outcomes depend on the order of execution or an unclean environment state.  
    * False positives/negatives due to data from one test influencing another.  
    * Difficulty in debugging test failures caused by data interference.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **No Isolation Framework:** Missing systematic approach to test data isolation between test runs  
    * **Shared Test Resources:** tests/integration/ tests appear to share configuration and potentially API keys  
    * **No Cleanup Mechanisms:** Absence of setUp/tearDown patterns for ensuring clean test environments  
    * **Billing Queue Interference:** app/services/billing.py:7-24 async queue could accumulate data across tests  
    * **Database State Management:** No evidence of database transaction isolation or rollback mechanisms for tests  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** Test execution environments and test data are designed to ensure complete isolation between individual tests or test runs, preventing interference and ensuring reproducible test results. Each test should ideally set up its own required data (e.g., unique API keys, users) and clean up afterwards.

## **Data for Edge Cases & Negative Testing**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Comprehensiveness and Accuracy of Edge Case/Negative Test Data  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.9 (Data for Edge Cases & Negative Testing)  
  * **Referenced Document:** docs/test\_design\_n\_planning/7\_9\_EdgeCases\_n\_NegativeTesting.md  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **Edge Case Test Implementation:** tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:100-279 includes some edge cases but limited boundary testing  
    * **Validation Schema Coverage:** app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py defines Pydantic schemas for request validation  
    * **Custom Validation:** app/providers/utils.py contains validation logic including parse\_data\_uri for image data handling  
    * **Error Handling:** app/routers/api\_v1.py:55-59 catches InvalidInput exceptions, app/main.py provides global error handlers  
    * **Integration Test Coverage:** tests/integration/7\_2\_EdgeCaseTesting.py exists but specific edge case data management unclear  
    * **Security Testing Data:** tests/integration/7\_3\_2\_LLM\_PromptInjection.py may contain negative test data for injection scenarios  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:  
    Testing the API's robustness requires data that pushes boundaries or is intentionally invalid.  
    * **Empty/Null Inputs:** Empty strings for prompts, null values for required fields, empty message arrays.  
    * **Maximal Inputs:** Prompts at the maximum context window limit, max\_tokens set to the highest allowed value, very long image data URIs.  
    * **Special Characters/Formats:** Prompts with complex Unicode, control characters, malformed data: URIs for images, invalid Base64 for file data.  
    * **Invalid LLM Parameters:** temperature out of range, non-integer max\_tokens, unsupported model IDs.  
    * **Security-related Negative Data:** Prompts containing potential injection payloads (SQLi, XSS, command injection attempts) to test how the API framework and adapters handle them before they reach the LLM (see RiskSurface\_for\_7\_3.md).  
  * **Potential Issues if Test Data is Deficient:**  
    * Unhandled exceptions or crashes when the API receives unexpected edge case data.  
    * Incorrect error codes or non-informative error messages for invalid inputs.  
    * Security vulnerabilities if negative test data for injection attacks is not comprehensive.  
    * Failure to test the robustness of LLM provider integrations when they receive unusual (but potentially valid from API's perspective) data.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **Limited Edge Case Coverage:** tests/integration/ contains some edge case files but lacks systematic boundary value testing  
    * **Missing Negative Test Data Repository:** No centralized collection of invalid inputs, malformed requests, or boundary conditions  
    * **Insufficient Unicode Testing:** tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:265-290 includes some Unicode testing but limited scope  
    * **No Systematic Boundary Testing:** Missing comprehensive testing of parameter limits, context windows, and token boundaries  
    * **Limited Security Test Data:** Need more comprehensive prompt injection and security-focused negative test data  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** A rich and well-maintained set of test data specifically designed for edge cases and negative testing scenarios, ensuring the API's validation logic and error handling are thoroughly exercised for LLM interactions.

## **Stateful Sequence Data Management**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Management of Data for Multi-Step/Conversational Tests  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.9 (Stateful Sequence Data Management)  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **Multi-turn Test Implementation:** tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:199-226 includes conversation history testing with messages array evolution  
    * **Chat Request Fixtures:** tests/unit/providers/conftest.py:26-40 provides core\_full\_chat\_request with SystemMessage, UserMessage, AssistantMessage sequence  
    * **Message Structure Testing:** tests/unit/providers/conftest.py:16-23 shows basic message array construction but limited conversational complexity  
    * **State Management Logic:** No dedicated test helpers or fixtures found for managing multi-step conversational sequences  
    * **Context Accumulation Testing:** Limited evidence of testing growing message arrays or token accumulation over conversation turns  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:  
    For chat completion, testing realistic conversations involves managing the sequence of messages (user, assistant, system).  
    * **Context Accumulation:** Ensuring the messages array correctly accumulates turns, and that this growing context is properly handled by the API and the LLM (e.g., performance implications, token limits).  
    * **Role Sequencing:** Testing valid and potentially invalid sequences of message roles.  
    * **State Reset:** Ensuring that the conversational context for one test sequence doesn't leak into another.  
  * **Potential Issues if Test Data is Deficient:**  
    * Inability to test how LLMs handle long or complex conversation histories.  
    * Missed bugs related to the API's processing of the messages array as it grows.  
    * Tests for features like "stop sequences" or "function/tool calling" (if added) might be inadequate if conversational state isn't managed correctly in tests.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **Limited Conversational Testing:** tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:199-226 shows basic multi-turn but lacks comprehensive conversation management  
    * **No State Management Helpers:** Missing dedicated test utilities for managing conversational context and state evolution  
    * **Insufficient Context Testing:** Limited testing of long conversation histories, token accumulation, and context window handling  
    * **Missing Conversation Templates:** No structured templates or patterns for different types of conversational testing scenarios  
    * **No Reset Mechanisms:** Absence of systematic state reset between conversational test sequences  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** Test data and logic effectively manage state for multi-step sequences, particularly for simulating chat conversations, allowing for realistic testing of conversational AI features.

## **LLM-Specific Test Data**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Quality and Relevance of LLM-Specific Test Assets  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.9 (LLM-Specific Test Data)  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **Missing Prompt Library:** Despite TestPlan.md requirements, no structured prompt library implementation found in codebase  
    * **Basic Test Prompts:** tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:27-279 contains hardcoded prompts but lacks categorization or systematic organization  
    * **Response Pattern Validation:** Limited evidence of structured response validation beyond basic assertion checks in integration tests  
    * **Token-Aware Testing:** No systematic token counting or context window testing mechanisms found  
    * **LLM-Specific Fixtures:** tests/unit/providers/conftest.py:15-75 provides basic request/response structures but lacks LLM-specific test data patterns  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:  
    This is core to testing LLM functionalities.  
    * **Prompt Library:**  
      * *Risk:* Library may lack diversity (topics, styles, complexity, length), not cover safety-testing prompts (e.g., for bias, harmful content generation), or not include prompts designed to test specific LLM capabilities (e.g., code generation, translation, summarization).  
    * **Expected Response Patterns:**  
      * *Risk:* Overly strict assertions for LLM output will lead to flaky tests. Conversely, too-loose assertions might miss actual regressions in LLM behavior or quality. Defining appropriate validation for non-deterministic output is challenging (e.g., keyword presence, structural checks, length constraints, semantic similarity if tools allow).  
    * **Token-Aware Test Data:**  
      * *Risk:* Difficulty in accurately crafting prompts that hit precise token limits for different models (due to varying tokenization schemes). Inaccurate token-aware data can lead to ineffective testing of context window and max\_tokens handling.  
  * **Potential Issues if Test Data is Deficient:**  
    * Inability to reliably test the functional correctness or quality of LLM responses.  
    * Flaky tests due to non-deterministic LLM outputs and poorly defined validation criteria.  
    * Failure to detect regressions in LLM behavior over time or across model updates.  
    * Inadequate testing of token limit handling.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **No Prompt Library Implementation:** Missing the structured, categorized prompt library specified in TestPlan.md requirements  
    * **Limited Response Validation:** Tests rely on basic string matching rather than sophisticated response pattern validation  
    * **No Token-Aware Testing:** Missing tools or methods for creating prompts calibrated to specific token lengths or context windows  
    * **Insufficient Prompt Diversity:** Current prompts in tests/integration/7\_9\_DataPrivacyTesting.py:27-279 lack topic, complexity, and style variation  
    * **No Semantic Validation:** Absence of semantic similarity checking or content quality assessment for LLM responses  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** A well-curated, diverse, and versioned prompt library exists. Clear strategies and tools are used for validating LLM responses (e.g., flexible pattern matching, semantic checks where feasible). Methods for creating token-aware test data are established and accurate enough for their purpose.

## **Test Data Version Control**

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Synchronization of Test Data with Code and API Versions  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.9 (Test Data Version Control)  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **Git Version Control:** Test files stored in version control but lacks dedicated test data artifact management  
    * **Schema Evolution:** app/providers/open\_ai/schemas.py defines API schemas but no systematic test data update processes  
    * **Test Data Files:** Limited test data files found - most test data hardcoded in test functions rather than versioned separately  
    * **Configuration Changes:** Backend model configuration changes would require manual test data updates  
    * **Missing Data Dependencies:** No tracking of relationships between test data versions and code versions  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:  
    Test data (especially prompts, expected output structures, parameter sets) can become outdated as the API or the LLMs evolve.  
    * If API request/response schemas change, test data that generates/validates these schemas must be updated.  
    * If new LLM models are added or existing ones are updated (potentially changing their behavior or tokenization), test prompts and expected response patterns might need revision.  
    * Without versioning, it's hard to run older tests against older API versions or understand why a test that once passed now fails.  
  * **Potential Issues if Test Data is Deficient:**  
    * Tests failing not due to bugs in the current code, but due to outdated test data.  
    * Tests passing but not actually validating the current behavior correctly because the data is misaligned.  
    * Difficulty in reproducing past test results or debugging regressions tied to data changes.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **No Dedicated Test Data Versioning:** Test data embedded in code rather than managed as separate versioned artifacts  
    * **Missing Update Processes:** No systematic procedures for updating test data when schemas or models change  
    * **No Dependency Tracking:** Lack of mapping between test data versions and corresponding API/model versions  
    * **Manual Data Management:** Test data updates require manual code changes rather than automated processes  
    * **No Historical Test Data:** Missing preservation of test datasets for regression testing and historical validation  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** Test data artifacts are versioned alongside the application code and test code. Clear processes exist for updating test data in response to API or LLM changes, ensuring continued relevance and accuracy of tests.

    * **Static Test Data:** Current test data in tests/integration/ appears static with no refresh mechanisms  
    * **Manual Review Processes:** No systematic review procedures for test data relevance and effectiveness  
    * **No Refresh Automation:** Missing pipeline or tools for generating new test data varieties or updating existing datasets  
  * Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:  
    If the same synthetic test data (especially prompts) is used repeatedly without updates, tests might become "overfitted" to that specific data set.  
    * The test suite might not detect regressions or issues that would only manifest with new or different types of prompts or data patterns.  
    * Emerging LLM vulnerabilities, new use cases, or changes in typical user interaction patterns might not be covered if the test data isn't refreshed.  
  * **Potential Issues if Test Data is Deficient:**  
    * Diminishing returns from the test suite over time as it fails to adapt to evolving risks or usage patterns.  
    * A false sense of security if tests pass only because they use stale, unchallenging data.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **No Refresh Strategy:** Missing systematic approach to updating and expanding test data over time  
    * **Static Test Suite:** Test data appears static without mechanisms for introducing new patterns or scenarios  
    * **No Automated Detection:** Missing tools for detecting stale or insufficient test data coverage  
    * **Manual Maintenance:** Test data updates require manual intervention rather than automated refresh processes  
    * **No Diversity Metrics:** Lack of measurement or tracking of test data diversity and coverage effectiveness  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** A strategy is in place to periodically review, update, and expand test data (particularly the LLM prompt library and edge case data) to maintain its relevance, diversity, and effectiveness in uncovering defects.

    Test data for LLM testing may contain synthetic representations of sensitive information, security scenarios, or compliance-related content that requires proper classification and handling.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **No Data Classification:** Missing systematic classification of test data by sensitivity level or compliance requirements  
    * **Uncontrolled Storage:** Test data stored in version control without consideration for sensitivity classification  
    * **No Access Controls:** Lack of differentiated access controls for different types of test data  
    * **Missing Compliance Framework:** No systematic validation of test data compliance with privacy regulations  
    * **Undefined Retention Policies:** No clear policies for test data lifecycle, retention, and disposal  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** Test data is properly classified, stored securely, and managed according to compliance requirements with appropriate access controls and retention policies.

* **Risk Surface Name/Identifier:** Test Environment Data Segregation  
  * **Relevant Test Plan Section(s):** 7.9 (Data Isolation, Compliance Validation)  
  * **Code Components/Processes Involved:**  
    * **Environment Configuration:** tests/integration/config.py test environment configuration management  
    * **Database Segregation:** Separation of test databases from production systems  
    * **API Key Isolation:** scripts/create\_admin\_user.py:19-49 test API key management and isolation from production keys  
    * **Cross-Environment Leakage Prevention:** Mechanisms to prevent test data from reaching production systems  
    * **Environment Validation:** Verification that test environments are properly isolated  
  * **Description of AI/LLM Interaction & Risk:**  
    LLM test data could inadvertently reach production systems or be mixed with production data, causing compliance issues or data contamination.  
  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **No Environment Validation:** Missing verification that test data remains isolated in test environments  
    * **Unclear Segregation:** No explicit mechanisms ensuring test data cannot reach production LLM providers  
    * **Configuration Risks:** tests/integration/config.py lacks validation for environment isolation  
    * **No Cross-Contamination Prevention:** Missing safeguards against test data mixing with production data  
  * **Expected Outcome for Test Data Management:** Complete segregation between test and production environments with validated isolation mechanisms and prevention of cross-environment data contamination.

## **Test Data Infrastructure and Tooling**

  * **Current Implementation Gaps:**  
    * **No Generation Framework:** Missing synthetic data generation tools despite TestPlan.md requirements for Faker and custom generators  
    * **Limited Automation:** Manual test data creation without automated generation or refresh capabilities  
    * **No Template System:** Absence of prompt templates or parameterized data generation for LLM testing  
    * **Quality Validation Missing:** No tools for assessing test data quality, diversity, or coverage effectiveness
