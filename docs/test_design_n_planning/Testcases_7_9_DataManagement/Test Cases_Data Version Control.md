# Test Cases for Test Data Version Control (Test Data Management Strategy)

This document outlines test cases for the **Synchronization of Test Data with Code and API Versions** risk surface, as detailed in the "Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.9: Test Data Management Strategy." This focuses on ensuring test data (prompts, expected outputs, parameter sets) remains valid and relevant as the API and LLMs evolve.

**Test Cases Summary: 13 (Original: 5, Enhanced: +8)**

**Referenced Code Components/Processes:**
* Test Data Storage: Test files stored in version control but lacks dedicated test data artifact management
* API Schemas: `app/providers/open_ai/schemas.py` (defines API schemas but no systematic test data update processes)
* Model Configuration: `app/config/settings.py:backend_map` (backend model configuration changes would require manual test data updates)
* Git Version Control: Test files stored in version control but missing dedicated test data versioning
* Test Data Files: Limited test data files found - most test data hardcoded in test functions rather than versioned separately
* Missing Data Dependencies: No tracking of relationships between test data versions and code versions

## General Test Case Components

* **ID:** Unique identifier (e.g., TDM\_VCS\_DATA\_ARTIFACTS\_001)
* **Category Ref:** TDM\_VERSION\_CONTROL
* **Description:** What specific aspect of test data versioning and synchronization is being tested/reviewed.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Test data embedded in code, lack of separate versioned test data artifacts, processes for updating test data.
* **Test Method/Action:** Review current practices; propose and implement versioning strategies.
* **Prerequisites:** Understanding of API evolution and how it impacts test data.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Test data artifacts are versioned alongside application code. Clear processes exist for updating test data in response to API or LLM changes, ensuring continued relevance and accuracy.
* **Verification Steps:** Review test data management procedures. Check for linkage between code versions and test data versions.

### Test Cases for Synchronization of Test Data with Code and API Versions

* **ID:** TDM\_VCS\_EMBEDDED\_DATA\_REVIEW\_001
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_VERSION\_CONTROL
    * **Description:** Review current practice of embedding test data (prompts, payloads) directly in test code. (Identified gap: "Test data embedded in code rather than managed as separate versioned artifacts").
    * **Exposure Point(s):** Test files in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Scan test files for hardcoded test data (especially complex prompts, expected response snippets, or large parameter sets).
        2.  Assess the maintainability of this approach when API schemas or LLM behaviors change.
    * **Prerequisites:** Access to codebase.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Assessment) Identify instances where embedding data in code is problematic for versioning and updates. Recommend moving such data to external, versioned files (e.g., JSON, YAML) if complexity warrants.
    * **Verification Steps:** Document findings. Categorize types of embedded data and their suitability for externalization.

* **ID:** TDM\_VCS\_SCHEMA\_CHANGE\_PROCESS\_002
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_VERSION\_CONTROL
    * **Description:** Verify that a process exists to review and update test data when API request/response schemas change. (Identified gap: "No systematic procedures for updating test data when schemas or models change").
    * **Exposure Point(s):** `app/providers/open_ai/schemas.py` (and other core schemas), related test data.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Simulate a non-trivial change to an API schema (e.g., add a required field, change a field's type, rename a field in `ChatCompletionRequest`).
        2.  Identify all test data (payloads, expected responses) that would be affected by this change.
        3.  Verify if current development/PR review processes include a step to update this test data.
    * **Prerequisites:** Understanding of schema dependencies in tests.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** A documented process (e.g., part of a PR checklist) ensures that schema changes trigger corresponding updates to all affected test data, preventing tests from becoming outdated or failing due to schema misalignment.
    * **Verification Steps:** Review development and code review guidelines. Test the process with a hypothetical schema change.

* **ID:** TDM\_VCS\_MODEL\_UPDATE\_PROCESS\_003
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_VERSION\_CONTROL
    * **Description:** Verify that a process exists to review and update test data (especially prompts and expected response patterns) when LLM models are added, removed, or significantly updated.
    * **Exposure Point(s):** `app/config/settings.py` (`backend_map`), LLM-specific test data.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Simulate an LLM provider updating a model referenced in `backend_map` (e.g., "claude-3-5-sonnet-v1" becomes "claude-3-5-sonnet-v2" with potentially different behavior or tokenization).
        2.  Identify tests that use this model ID and their associated prompts/expected outputs.
        3.  Verify if processes require re-validation or adaptation of this test data.
    * **Prerequisites:** N/A.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Model updates or changes in `backend_map` trigger a review and potential update of related test data to ensure tests remain relevant and accurately reflect the behavior of the new/updated LLM.
    * **Verification Steps:** Review model management and test maintenance procedures.

* **ID:** TDM\_VCS\_DATA\_DEPENDENCY\_TRACKING\_GAP\_004

    * **Exposure Point(s):** Test data management and version control system.
    * **Test Method/Action:** Review how test data is stored and if its version is linked to specific code commits or API release versions.
    * **Prerequisites:** N/A.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Assessment) Implement a strategy if current practices are insufficient. This could involve:
        * Storing versioned test data sets in separate files/directories.
        * Tagging test data commits in Git to align with code releases.
        * Using test data management tools that support versioning.
    * **Verification Steps:** Document current practices and propose improvements for better dependency tracking.

    * **Exposure Point(s):** Test data storage and version control.
    * **Test Method/Action:** Review if old test data that identified specific bugs is retained and can be easily run against older code versions (e.g., via Git tags).
    * **Prerequisites:** N/A.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Assessment) A strategy is in place to archive and retrieve historical test data sets as needed, facilitating debugging of regressions and validation against past behaviors.
    * **Verification Steps:** Review current archival practices. If inadequate, propose a method for linking specific test data versions (or tests themselves) to bug reports or code versions where they were relevant.
