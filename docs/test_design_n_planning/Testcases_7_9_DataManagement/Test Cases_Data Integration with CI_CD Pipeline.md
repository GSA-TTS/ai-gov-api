    * **Exposure Point(s):** CI/CD test stages.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Review CI/CD pipeline scripts for any steps that explicitly validate test data (e.g., schema checks for test data files, linters for prompts, checks for synthetic PII consistency).
        2.  Consider if a simple validation step (e.g., checking JSON validity of test data files) could be added.
    * **Prerequisites:** CI/CD pipeline definition.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Assessment) The CI/CD pipeline includes a stage to perform basic validation on test data artifacts before tests are run, preventing pipeline failures due to malformed or inconsistent test data.
