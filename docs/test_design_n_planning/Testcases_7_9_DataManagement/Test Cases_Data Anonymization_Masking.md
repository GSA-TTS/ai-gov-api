# Test Cases for Data Anonymization/Masking (Test Data Management Strategy)

This document outlines test cases for the **Effectiveness of Data Anonymization** risk surface, as detailed in the "Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.9: Test Data Management Strategy." This focuses on verifying that if any production-derived data were used for testing, or if LLMs generate PII-like data, anonymization/masking processes are effective, especially concerning log data.

**Test Cases Summary: 14 (Original: 6, Enhanced: +8)**

**Referenced Code Components/Processes:**
* PII Filtering Implementation: (Currently missing, referenced as PIIFilteringProcessor in `app/logs/logging_config.py:1-54`)
* Logging Configuration: `app/logs/logging_config.py:11-48` (structured logging with JSON/console rendering)
* Privacy Test Coverage: `tests/integration/7_9_DataPrivacyTesting.py:100-128` (error message privacy testing)
* Synthetic PII Handling: `tests/integration/7_9_DataPrivacyTesting.py:27-98` (synthetic PII placeholders)
* Logging Middleware: `app/logs/middleware.py:11-47` (request logging with privacy controls)
* Context Management: `app/logs/logging_context.py` (context variable binding for structured logging)

## General Test Case Components

* **ID:** Unique identifier (e.g., TDM\_ANON\_EFFECTIVENESS\_001)
* **Category Ref:** TDM\_DATA\_ANONYMIZATION
* **Description:** What specific feature/vulnerability related to data anonymization is being tested.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Test data containing PII/sensitive info (if used), logs generated during test runs (`app/logs/logging_config.py`), test reports.
* **Test Method/Action:** Introduce mock PII into test inputs/prompts. Inspect logs and test outputs for exposure of this PII.
* **Prerequisites:** Understanding of PII types. Access to logs. If PIIFilteringProcessor is implemented, ensure it's active.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Robust anonymization processes are in place. Any PIIFilteringProcessor effectively redacts PII from logs generated during test execution. Test outputs do not contain sensitive information.
* **Verification Steps:** Review logs and test outputs for the presence of unmasked mock PII.

    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Send a chat request that might coax the LLM to generate PII-like data (e.g., "Create a fictional user profile with a name, email, and phone number.").

    * **Test Method/Action:** Review the tests in `7_9_DataPrivacyTesting.py`.
    * **Prerequisites:** Access to codebase.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Assessment) Determine if existing tests validate PII *redaction in logs* or primarily focus on *not leaking PII in error messages*. (Risk analysis notes: "tests error message privacy but no systematic anonymization validation").
    * **Verification Steps:** Document findings. If log anonymization is not covered, recommend new integration tests (contingent on PIIFilteringProcessor implementation).
