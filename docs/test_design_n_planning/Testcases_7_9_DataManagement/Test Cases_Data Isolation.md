# Test Cases for Data Isolation (Test Data Management Strategy)

This document outlines test cases for the **Test Data Interference in Shared Test Environments** risk surface, as detailed in the "Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.9: Test Data Management Strategy." This focuses on ensuring that tests do not interfere with each other due to shared state or resources.

**Test Cases Summary: 14 (Original: 6, Enhanced: +8)**

**Referenced Code Components/Processes:**
* Test Environment Setup: `tests/conftest.py:1-6` (basic project path configuration)
* Database Models: `app/users/models.py` and `app/auth/models.py` (user and API key schemas requiring isolation)
* API Key Management: `scripts/create_admin_user.py:22-71` (creates keys with manager_id but no isolation mechanisms)
* Integration Test Configuration: `tests/integration/config.py` (test configuration without data isolation patterns)
* Billing Service: `app/services/billing.py:7-24` (queue-based billing could interfere between tests)
* Database Session Management: `app/db/session.py:22-33` (transaction isolation support available)
* Missing Teardown Logic: No systematic setUp/tearDown patterns found in test suites

## General Test Case Components

* **ID:** Unique identifier (e.g., TDM\_ISO\_APIKEY\_STATE\_001)
* **Category Ref:** TDM\_DATA\_ISOLATION
* **Description:** What specific aspect of data isolation is being tested.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Shared test databases, shared API keys used across tests, persistent state in services (e.g., billing queue if not cleared), file system (if tests write files).
* **Test Method/Action:** Run tests concurrently or in specific sequences to detect interference. Verify cleanup procedures.
* **Prerequisites:** Test environment where concurrent execution or sequential runs can occur.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Test execution environments and test data are designed to ensure complete isolation between individual tests or test runs, preventing interference and ensuring reproducible test results.
* **Verification Steps:** Observe test outcomes for flakiness. Verify data cleanup. Check for state leakage between tests.

### Test Cases for Test Data Interference in Shared Test Environments

* **ID:** TDM\_ISO\_APIKEY\_STATE\_001
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_DATA\_ISOLATION
    * **Description:** Verify that tests modifying API key state (e.g., deactivation, scope change - if testable via admin functions) do not affect other tests relying on the same key's initial state.
    * **Exposure Point(s):** Shared API keys in test environment, `api_keys` database table.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Test A uses a specific shared API key (`shared_key_1`) and expects it to be active with scope `X`.
        2.  Test B (run concurrently or immediately after, before potential cleanup) deactivates `shared_key_1` or changes its scope.
        3.  Test A (or a repeat of Test A) runs again.
    * **Prerequisites:** Admin functions to modify API key state (e.g., via admin-scoped API calls or direct DB manipulation for testing).
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Each test should ideally use its own uniquely generated API key, or if shared keys are used for specific reasons, tests that modify state must robustly restore the original state. Test A should not fail due to Test B's actions if isolation is proper (e.g., Test A uses a different key, or Test B cleans up its changes).
    * **Verification Steps:** Run tests in parallel if possible. Check for intermittent failures in tests that rely on specific API key states. Ensure test setup/teardown correctly manages API key creation/deletion/state restoration for each test or suite. (Identified gap: "No systematic setUp/tearDown patterns found").

* **ID:** TDM\_ISO\_USER\_DATA\_002
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_DATA\_ISOLATION
    * **Description:** Verify that tests creating or modifying user data (associated with `manager_id`) do not interfere with other tests.
    * **Exposure Point(s):** `users` database table, shared `manager_id` values across tests.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Test A creates a user with a specific email/`manager_id`.
        2.  Test B attempts to create a user with the same email/`manager_id` or queries for users and gets affected by Test A's data.
    * **Prerequisites:** User creation/modification capabilities in tests.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Tests use unique identifiers for created users (e.g., random UUIDs for `manager_id`, unique emails per test run) or ensure proper cleanup. Failures in one test due to data conflicts (e.g., "user already exists") should not cause unrelated tests to fail.
    * **Verification Steps:** Review test setup for unique user data generation. Check for tests failing due to pre-existing data from other tests.

* **ID:** TDM\_ISO\_BILLING\_QUEUE\_INTERFERENCE\_003
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_DATA\_ISOLATION
    * **Description:** Verify that test-generated billing records via `app/services/billing.py` do not interfere with assertions in other tests if the queue is not cleared or isolated.
    * **Exposure Point(s):** `billing_queue` in `app/services/billing.py`.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Test A makes several API calls generating billing events.
        2.  Test B (running after A without a queue clear) makes an API call and then attempts to assert the state of the billing queue or the number of items processed by a (mocked) `billing_worker`.
    * **Prerequisites:** (Identified gap: "billing_queue could accumulate data across tests").
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Tests that need to inspect the billing queue or its effects should have a mechanism to clear it before the test or assert based on relative changes, not absolute numbers from a potentially shared queue. Ideally, each test concerned with billing would verify only the events it generated.
    * **Verification Steps:** If tests make assertions on billing queue state/output, ensure they are not affected by prior tests. Implement per-test queue isolation or cleanup if necessary.

* **ID:** TDM\_ISO\_DB\_STATE\_MANAGEMENT\_004
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_DATA\_ISOLATION
    * **Description:** Assess the lack of database transaction isolation or rollback mechanisms specifically for tests that modify DB state.
    * **Exposure Point(s):** Database interactions within tests. (Identified gap: "No evidence of database transaction isolation or rollback mechanisms for tests").
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Review integration tests that write to the database (e.g., tests for admin functions creating users/keys).
        2.  Check if these tests use mechanisms like:
            * Wrapping test DB operations in a transaction that is rolled back at teardown.
            * Using a separate, ephemeral test database for each test run or suite.
            * Explicitly deleting created data in teardown phases.
    * **Prerequisites:** Integration tests that modify database state.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Assessment) Tests that modify data should use strategies to ensure they do not leave persistent side effects that impact subsequent tests, promoting reproducibility and isolation.
    * **Verification Steps:** Review test setup/teardown logic for database state management. Identify tests vulnerable to dirty DB state.

* **ID:** TDM\_ISO\_CONCURRENT\_TEST\_EXECUTION\_005
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_DATA\_ISOLATION
    * **Description:** If tests are run in parallel (e.g., with `pytest-xdist`), verify that there's no interference due to shared resources (database, file system, global states).
    * **Exposure Point(s):** Any shared resource accessed by tests.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Run the entire integration test suite (or a significant portion) in parallel.
        2.  Compare pass/fail rates and specific failures with a sequential run of the same tests.
    * **Prerequisites:** Parallel test execution capability.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Test results are consistent between parallel and sequential runs. No new failures appear only in parallel execution that would indicate resource contention or state corruption.
    * **Verification Steps:** Compare test reports from parallel and sequential runs. Investigate any discrepancies.

* **ID:** TDM\_ISO\_TEST\_CLEANUP\_MECHANISMS\_006
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_DATA\_ISOLATION
    * **Description:** Review and verify the implementation of `setUp` and `tearDown` (or equivalent pytest fixtures) for managing test-specific data and state.
    * **Exposure Point(s):** Test fixture implementations in `conftest.py` and individual test files. (Identified gap: "Absence of setUp/tearDown patterns for ensuring clean test environments").
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Identify tests that create data (e.g., new API keys, users) or modify shared state.
        2.  Review their fixture usage and teardown logic to ensure created resources are cleaned up.
    * **Prerequisites:** Test suite.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** All test-generated data and state modifications are properly cleaned up after test completion to prevent interference with other tests.
    * **Verification Steps:** Manually inspect database or other shared resources after tests that create data to ensure cleanup. Add explicit teardown logic to fixtures where missing.
