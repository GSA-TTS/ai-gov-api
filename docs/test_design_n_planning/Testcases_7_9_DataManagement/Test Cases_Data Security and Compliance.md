    * **Exposure Point(s):** Test data management policies.
    * **Test Method/Action:** Review project documentation for any test data classification guidelines.
    * **Prerequisites:** N/A.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Assessment) A clear policy for test data classification is established and documented, guiding how different types of test data are handled, stored, and accessed.

    * **Exposure Point(s):** Test data files containing synthetic PII. Version control system.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Identify all test data that uses synthetic PII placeholders.

        3.  Review access controls to the repositories/directories where this data is stored (e.g., Git repo permissions).
    * **Prerequisites:** Access to test data.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Test data with synthetic PII is handled with care, clearly identified as non-real, and access to it is controlled appropriately (even if less stringent than real PII, it shouldn't be publicly exposed if the patterns mimic real PII too closely or are used for sensitive security tests). (Identified gap: "Uncontrolled Storage").
    * **Verification Steps:** Review test data and storage access. Recommend stricter controls or better labeling if needed.

* **ID:** TDM\_SEC\_ACCESS\_CONTROL\_TEST\_DATASETS\_003

    * **Prerequisites:** Test data classification policy (from TDM\_SEC\_CLASSIFY\_POLICY\_001).
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Assessment) Access to test datasets containing sensitive patterns (e.g., complex security exploit payloads, very realistic synthetic PII) is more restricted than general functional test data.
    * **Verification Steps:** Review current access and propose a tiered access model if necessary.

* **ID:** TDM\_SEC\_COMPLIANCE\_FRAMEWORK\_GAP\_004
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_DATA\_SECURITY_COMPLIANCE
    * **Description:** Assess the lack of a systematic framework for validating test data compliance with relevant privacy regulations (even for synthetic data, to ensure it doesn't accidentally become too real or violate data minimization for test scenarios). (Identified gap: "Missing Compliance Framework").
    * **Exposure Point(s):** Test data creation and review processes.
    * **Test Method/Action:** Review how synthetic data is generated and if there are checks to ensure it doesn't inadvertently mirror real sensitive data structures too closely or include real (even publicly available) PII.
    * **Prerequisites:** Understanding of relevant privacy regulations.

    * **Exposure Point(s):** Test scripts, CI/CD pipelines deploying to test environments, provider credentials configured for test environments.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Review how test scripts and CI/CD pipelines target test environments (e.g., ensure API endpoints and provider credentials are for non-production).
        2.  If tests involve writing data (e.g., hypothetical user profile creation), ensure it targets a test database.
    * **Prerequisites:** Access to CI/CD and test configurations.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Strict separation of test and production data flows. Test environment LLM provider credentials/projects are sandboxed and different from production. (Identified gap: "Unclear Segregation" ensuring test data cannot reach production LLM providers).
    * **Verification Steps:** Audit CI/CD variables and test script configurations for endpoint and credential isolation.
