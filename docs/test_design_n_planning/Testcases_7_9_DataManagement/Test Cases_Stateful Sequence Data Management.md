# Test Cases for Stateful Sequence Data Management (Test Data Management Strategy)

This document outlines test cases for the **Management of Data for Multi-Step/Conversational Tests** risk surface, as detailed in the "Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.9: Test Data Management Strategy." This focuses on verifying the API's ability to handle sequences of messages in chat completions, ensuring context is maintained and processed correctly by LLMs.

**Test Cases Summary: 14 (Original: 6, Enhanced: +8)**

**Referenced Code Components/Processes:**
* Multi-turn Test Implementation: `tests/integration/7_9_DataPrivacyTesting.py:199-226` (conversation history testing with messages array evolution)
* Chat Request Fixtures: `tests/unit/providers/conftest.py:26-40` (core_full_chat_request with SystemMessage, UserMessage, AssistantMessage sequence)
* Message Structure Testing: `tests/unit/providers/conftest.py:16-23` (basic message array construction but limited conversational complexity)
* API Schema: `app/providers/open_ai/schemas.py` (`messages` array in `ChatCompletionRequest`)
* State Management Logic: No dedicated test helpers or fixtures found for managing multi-step conversational sequences
* Context Accumulation Testing: Limited evidence of testing growing message arrays or token accumulation over conversation turns

## General Test Case Components

* **ID:** Unique identifier (e.g., TDM\_STATEFUL\_CONTEXT\_ACCUM\_001)
* **Category Ref:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_DATA
* **Description:** What specific aspect of stateful sequence data management is being tested.
* **Exposure Point(s):** `messages` array in `/api/v1/chat/completions`, LLM provider's handling of conversation history.
* **Test Method/Action:** Send a sequence of chat requests, building up the `messages` array with prior user and assistant turns.
* **Prerequisites:** Valid API key.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** The API correctly transmits the accumulated conversational context. The LLM's responses demonstrate understanding and utilization of this context. No context leakage between separate, unrelated conversations.
* **Verification Steps:** Analyze LLM responses for contextual relevance. Check for errors related to history processing.

### Test Cases for Management of Data for Multi-Step/Conversational Tests

* **ID:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_CONTEXT\_ACCUM\_001
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_DATA
    * **Description:** Verify correct accumulation and LLM processing of a growing `messages` array (conversation history).
    * **Exposure Point(s):** `/api/v1/chat/completions` `messages` field.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Turn 1: User sends "My name is Bob. My favorite color is blue."
        2.  Turn 2 (Assistant responds): Capture assistant response.
        3.  Turn 3: User sends "What is my favorite color?" including history from Turn 1 & 2.
        4.  Turn 4 (Assistant responds): Capture assistant response.
        5.  Turn 5: User sends "What was my name?" including history from Turns 1-4.
    * **Prerequisites:** Valid API key.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:**
        * Response to Turn 3 should correctly state "blue".
        * Response to Turn 5 should correctly state "Bob".
        The LLM utilizes the provided history.
    * **Verification Steps:** Check assistant responses in turns 3 and 5 for correctness based on accumulated context. (Similar to existing tests in `7_9_DataPrivacyTesting.py`).

* **ID:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_ROLE\_SEQUENCING\_002
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_DATA
    * **Description:** Test valid and potentially unusual (but schema-valid) sequences of message roles.
    * **Exposure Point(s):** `messages` array, role validation by Pydantic, provider handling of role sequences.
    * **Test Method/Action:** Send chat requests with `messages` arrays having sequences like:
        1.  User -> Assistant -> User (Standard)
        2.  System -> User -> Assistant -> User (Standard with system prompt)
        3.  User -> User (Consecutive user messages - some models handle this by concatenating)
        4.  Assistant -> User (Starting with assistant - unusual, tests provider tolerance)
    * **Prerequisites:** Valid API key.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** API accepts schema-valid role sequences. Provider processes them according to its capabilities. No API framework errors due to role sequence if schema-valid. Unusual sequences might lead to suboptimal LLM responses but not API failure.
    * **Verification Steps:** Ensure API returns 200 OK for schema-valid sequences. Observe LLM response quality/coherence for unusual sequences.

* **ID:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_CONTEXT\_TOKEN\_LIMIT\_003
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_DATA
    * **Description:** Test behavior when the accumulated `messages` array approaches or exceeds the LLM's context token limit.
    * **Exposure Point(s):** `messages` array, LLM provider's context window.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Incrementally build a long conversation history in the `messages` array.
        2.  Send requests, monitoring `prompt_tokens` in the usage response.
        3.  Continue adding to history until a request fails due to context length or the provider truncates history.
    * **Prerequisites:** Valid API key. Knowledge of approximate model context window. (Identified gap: "Limited testing of long conversation histories, token accumulation, and context window handling").
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** API relays requests. Provider either returns an error (e.g., input too long) when context limit is exceeded, or implicitly truncates the history. API should relay this outcome gracefully.
    * **Verification Steps:** Observe API responses as history grows. If an error occurs, verify it's related to context length. If truncation occurs, note the behavior.

* **ID:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_CONVERSATION\_RESET\_004
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_DATA
    * **Description:** Verify that two separate chat completion requests (even with the same API key) do not share context unless explicitly provided in the `messages` array. (Confirms statelessness per request).
    * **Exposure Point(s):** API request handling.
    * **Test Method/Action:**
        1.  Request 1: User sends "My secret word is 'banana'."
        2.  Request 2 (new request, fresh `messages` array): User sends "What is my secret word?"
    * **Prerequisites:** Valid API key.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** LLM response to Request 2 should indicate it doesn't know the secret word, as Request 1's context was not part of Request 2's `messages`.
    * **Verification Steps:** Check LLM response to Request 2.

* **ID:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_CONVERSATION\_TEMPLATES\_GAP\_005
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_DATA

    * **Verification Steps:** Document current practices. Outline potential conversation templates.

* **ID:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_HELPER\_UTILITIES\_GAP\_006
    * **Category Ref:** TDM\_STATEFUL\_DATA
    * **Description:** Assess the lack of dedicated test utilities for managing conversational context and state evolution in tests. (Identified gap: "No State Management Helpers").
    * **Exposure Point(s):** Test code structure for conversational tests.
    * **Test Method/Action:** Review how conversation history (`messages` array) is built and managed within test functions.
    * **Prerequisites:** N/A.
    * **Expected Secure Outcome:** (Assessment) Recommendation for creating helper functions or classes to simplify the construction and management of `messages` arrays for multi-turn tests, reducing boilerplate and errors.
    * **Verification Steps:** Document current practices. Suggest potential helper utility designs.
