  * Inspect the item passed to the mocked billing_queue.put().  
  * Assert item contains correct API key ID and manager_id.  
  * Assert token counts are present and plausible.  
  * Assert model_id matches the requested model.  
* **Code Reference:** app/services/billing.py:7-14 defines billing infrastructure, usage collection needs to be implemented in routers.  
* **Implementation Status:** ðŸ”§ Requires Setup - billing integration not yet implemented in API routes.

* **Prerequisites:** Database access. Mockable billing queue. Multimodal model.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** The prompt\_tokens in the billing item reflect the combined cost of text and image(s).  
* **Verification Steps:** Inspect prompt\_tokens in the billing item. It should be higher than a text-only request and plausible for the image content based on provider pricing/tokenization rules. (Exact validation might require provider-specific tokenizers or known values).

### **FV\_AGY\_USAGE\_STREAMING\_ATTRIBUTION\_001**

* **Category Ref:** FV\_AGY\_USAGE  
* **Description:** Verify usage from a streaming /chat/completions request is correctly attributed (assuming usage is reported at the end or can be calculated).  
* **Exposure Point(s):** Usage collection for streaming responses.  
* **Test Method/Action:** Make a streaming /chat/completions request. Mock billing queue.

* **Verification Steps:** Inspect mocked queue item. Token counts should correspond to the complete generated stream.

## **3\. Quota Enforcement (Functional \- If Implemented)**

*(These tests depend on the specific implementation of quota logic, e.g., in billing\_worker or a separate service. The risk analysis mentions it under Agency-Specific testing.)*

* **Exposure Point(s):** User creation endpoint (if any via API, or script create\_admin\_user.py), API key generation logic.  
* **Test Method/Action:**  
  1. Create a new user (e.g. with manager\_id="new\_agency").  
  2. Generate an API key for this user with scopes=\["models:chat"\].  
  3. Attempt to use this key for /chat/completions.  
* **Prerequisites:** Mechanism to create users and API keys.

## **5\. Multi-Tenant Isolation (Functional Spot Checks)**

These tests aim to ensure that concurrent requests from different agencies do not interfere with each other's context, model configurations, or billing.

### **FV\_AGY\_ISOLATION\_CONCURRENT\_REQUESTS\_001**

* **Category Ref:** FV\_AGY\_ISOLATION  
* **Description:** Test concurrent requests from two different API keys (different manager\_ids) to ensure correct attribution and no cross-contamination.  
* **Exposure Point(s):** Request context handling, billing attribution, provider client instantiation.  
* **Test Method/Action:**  
  1. Create API Key A for Agency1 and API Key B for Agency2.  
  2. Mock the billing queue.  
  3. Simultaneously (or in rapid succession) send a /chat/completions request using Key A and another using Key B, each for a different model if possible, or with slightly different prompts.  
* **Prerequisites:** Database access. Mockable billing queue. Ability to make concurrent requests.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome:**  
  * Both requests complete successfully (200 OK).  
  * Two distinct items are put on the billing queue.  
  * Billing item 1 is correctly attributed to Key A / Agency1 and its respective model/prompt.  
  * Billing item 2 is correctly attributed to Key B / Agency2 and its respective model/prompt.  
  * Responses received are appropriate for their respective prompts.  
* **Verification Steps:**  
  * Inspect the items in the mocked billing queue; verify correct and distinct api\_key\_id, manager\_id, and request details for each.  
  * Verify responses are correct for each initial request.  
  * Check logs for any signs of context bleeding or misattribution (if detailed logging is available).

### **FV\_AGY\_ISOLATION\_PROVIDER\_CLIENTS\_001**

* **Category Ref:** FV\_AGY\_ISOLATION  
* **Description:** Verify that provider clients (e.g., Boto3 client for Bedrock) are instantiated or used in a way that maintains isolation if agency-specific configurations (e.g., different AWS roles/regions per agency, if ever supported) were to be used. (Current implementation seems to use global clients, so this tests that global client usage doesn't cause issues with concurrent, differently attributed requests).  
* **Exposure Point(s):** Provider client instantiation and usage in app/providers/{bedrock|vertex\_ai}.  
* **Test Method/Action:** Similar to FV\_AGY\_ISOLATION\_CONCURRENT\_REQUESTS\_001, make concurrent requests from different "agencies" (API keys with different manager\_id).  
* **Prerequisites:** As above.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Requests are processed correctly without interference, even if a shared provider client instance is used internally, as long as the calls to the provider SDKs correctly pass distinct parameters derived from each request (e.g. model ID, prompt).  
* **Verification Steps:**  
  * Successful completion of both requests.  
  * Correct billing attribution.  
  * No errors indicating misconfigured or crossed provider sessions (unlikely with current global client model unless state is improperly managed within the client wrapper).
