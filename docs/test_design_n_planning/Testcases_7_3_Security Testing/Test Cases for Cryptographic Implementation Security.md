## **Test Cases Summary**
**Total Test Cases: 18 (Original: 7, Enhanced: +11)**

### **Basic Cryptographic Security**

* **ID:** CRYPTO\_KEY\_ENTROPY\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** Crypto \- Implementation Security  
  * **Description:** Verify API keys generated by generate\_api\_key in app/auth/utils.py have sufficient entropy.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** secrets.token\_urlsafe(num\_bytes) in generate\_api\_key.  
  * **Test Method/Action:**  
    1. Review num\_bytes parameter (default is 32 bytes).  
    2. Generate a sample of keys and visually inspect for randomness.  
    3. (Optional) Perform statistical randomness tests on a large sample of generated random parts if high assurance is needed.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Access to code.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** num\_bytes should be sufficient (e.g., 32 bytes provides 256 bits of entropy, which is strong). secrets.token\_urlsafe is a cryptographically secure random generator.  
  * **Verification Steps:**  
    1. Confirm num\_bytes is 32 or higher in generate\_api\_key.  
    2. Confirm secrets.token\_urlsafe is used for the random part of the key.  
* **ID:** CRYPTO\_HASH\_ALGORITHM\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** Crypto \- Implementation Security  
  * **Description:** Verify that a strong, standard hashing algorithm is used for storing API key representations.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** hashlib.sha256 in generate\_api\_key and verify\_api\_key\_hash in app/auth/utils.py.  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Code review.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Access to code.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** SHA256 is used. (Note: For password hashing, PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 with a salt are generally recommended over plain SHA256. For API keys, which are high-entropy secrets, a strong hash like SHA256 is often considered acceptable, but salting would still be a good practice if not already part of a framework that hashlib is used within). The current implementation uses plain SHA256 without an explicit salt managed by the application code.  
  * **Verification Steps:** Confirm hashlib.sha256 is the algorithm implemented.  
* **ID:** CRYPTO\_HASH\_SALTING\_001 (Improvement Area)  
  * **Category Ref:** Crypto \- Implementation Security  
  * **Description:** Verify if API key hashes are salted to protect against rainbow table attacks.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** Hashing logic in app/auth/utils.py. APIKey.hashed\_key storage.  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Code review.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Access to code.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Ideally, a unique salt should be generated for each API key and combined with the key before hashing, or a library that handles this internally (like passlib) should be used. The current hashlib.sha256(api\_key.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest() does not show explicit per-key salting.  
  * **Verification Steps:** Review code for salt generation and usage during hashing. If not present, this is a finding for improvement.  
* **ID:** CRYPTO\_TIMING\_ATTACK\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** Crypto \- Implementation Security  
  * **Description:** Verify that API key hash comparison (verify\_api\_key\_hash) is resistant to timing attacks.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** secrets.compare\_digest in verify\_api\_key\_hash in app/auth/utils.py.  
  * **Test Method/Action:**  
    1. Code review to confirm secrets.compare\_digest is used.  
    2. (Optional/Advanced) Attempt to measure response times for authentication with keys that are incrementally "closer" to a valid key's hash. This is complex to do reliably.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Access to code. A valid API key and its hash.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** secrets.compare\_digest is used for comparing the provided key's hash with the stored hash, as this function is designed to be constant-time.  
  * **Verification Steps:** Confirm usage of secrets.compare\_digest(provided\_key\_hash.encode(), stored\_hash.encode()) in verify\_api\_key\_hash. (Current code uses this).  
* **ID:** CRYPTO\_KEY\_STORAGE\_001

  * **Prerequisites:** API deployed with HTTPS.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Supports TLS 1.2+, prefers TLS 1.3. Disables weak ciphers (e.g., RC4, 3DES, SSLv3). Uses strong key exchange and encryption algorithms.
