# **Test Cases for Security Middleware & HTTP Headers**

## **Introduction**

This document outlines test cases for **Security Middleware & HTTP Headers** as identified in the "Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.3.md" (Section 3). These tests focus on the configuration and effectiveness of security-related middleware (like CORS) and the presence and correctness of HTTP security headers, which protect the LLM API endpoints from various web-based attacks.  
**References:**

* docs/test\_design\_n\_planning/Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.3.md (Section 3\. Security Middleware & HTTP Headers)  
* app/main.py (CORS configuration, global exception handlers)  
* app/logs/middleware.py (StructlogMiddleware, though less about security headers, more about request processing)  
* Deployment configurations (e.g., Nginx, Traefik, Cloud Gateway settings for HTTP security headers, as these are often set outside the FastAPI app).

## **General Test Case Components Template**

* **ID:** Unique identifier  
* **Category Ref:** HTTP \- Middleware & Headers Security  
* **Description:** What specific middleware behavior or HTTP security header is being tested.  
* **Exposure Point(s):** HTTP request/response headers, CORS middleware logic, error responses.  
* **Test Method/Action:** Send requests with specific Origin headers, inspect response headers, attempt requests that test middleware logic.  
* **Prerequisites:** API running in a production-like environment (ideally behind a reverse proxy that would set security headers).  
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** CORS policy is correctly enforced. Appropriate HTTP security headers are present and correctly configured. Middleware processes requests securely.  
* **Verification Steps:** Inspect HTTP response headers and bodies. Observe API behavior.

## **Test Cases Summary**
**Total Test Cases: 19 (Original: 9, Enhanced: +10)**

### **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

* **ID:** HTTPSEC\_CORS\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** HTTP \- Middleware & Headers Security  
  * **Description:** Verify CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin for trusted origins when allow\_credentials=True.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** CORSMiddleware in app/main.py.  
  * **Test Method/Action:**  
    1. Configure origins in app/main.py to a specific trusted domain (e.g., \["https://trusted.example.com"\]) and keep allow\_credentials=True.  
    2. Send an API request (e.g., GET /api/v1/models) with Origin: https://trusted.example.com header.  
    3. Send another request with Origin: https://untrusted.example.com.  
  * **Prerequisites:** API running with modified CORS origins. Valid API key.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:**  
    * For the trusted origin, the response includes Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted.example.com and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true.  
    * For the untrusted origin, the request might be blocked by CORS policy (browser behavior), or the server response should NOT include Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://untrusted.example.com or Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \* if allow\_credentials=True. The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header should be absent or reflect the single allowed origin if the server sends it regardless.  
  * **Verification Steps:** Inspect response headers for Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials. (Note: The current code in app/main.py has origins \= \["http://localhost", "http://localhost:8080", "\*"\]. If allow\_credentials=True is used with allow\_origins=\["\*"\], this is a security misconfiguration. Browsers will block such responses.)  
* **ID:** HTTPSEC\_CORS\_002  
  * **Category Ref:** HTTP \- Middleware & Headers Security  
  * **Description:** Verify Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers in OPTIONS preflight responses.

  * **Prerequisites:** API running. CORS configured with specific trusted origin.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** The OPTIONS response (200 or 204\) should include:  
    * Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \<configured\_trusted\_origin\>  
    * Access-Control-Allow-Methods listing allowed methods (e.g., GET, POST, OPTIONS). Should not be \* if not all methods are intended. (Current code has allow\_methods=\["\*"\]).  
    * Access-Control-Allow-Headers listing allowed headers. (Current code has allow\_headers=\["\*"\]).  
    * Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true (if set).  
  * **Verification Steps:** Inspect headers of the OPTIONS response.

  * **Prerequisites:** API running. Mocking capability.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Error responses are generic, conform to the defined error schema (e.g., 500 error with request\_id, 400/409 for IntegrityError), and do not leak stack traces or raw exception messages to the client.
