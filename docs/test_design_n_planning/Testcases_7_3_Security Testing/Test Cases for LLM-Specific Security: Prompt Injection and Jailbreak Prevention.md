# **Test Cases for LLM-Specific Security: Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Prevention**

## **Introduction**

This document outlines test cases for **LLM-Specific Security Testing**, focusing on **Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Prevention**, as identified in the "Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.3.md". These tests aim to evaluate how the API framework and the downstream LLMs handle attempts to manipulate or bypass intended operational parameters and safety guidelines through crafted prompts.

## **General Test Case Components Template**

* **ID:** Unique identifier
* **Category Ref:** LLM - Prompt Injection
* **Description:** What specific prompt injection or jailbreak technique is being tested.
* **Exposure Point(s):** messages[].content in /chat/completions, input in /embeddings. Adapter logic transforming these inputs. LLM provider's prompt processing.
* **Test Method/Action:** Send requests with specially crafted prompts designed to subvert LLM instructions or safety measures.
* **Prerequisites:** Valid API key with models:inference or models:embedding scope.
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** The API framework should faithfully transmit the structured input. The downstream LLM provider is primarily responsible for resisting the injection. The API should relay the LLM's response (which ideally shows resistance) or any errors gracefully. The API framework itself should not introduce new vulnerabilities during prompt handling.
* **Verification Steps:** Analyze LLM responses for evidence of successful injection (e.g., revealing system prompts, generating harmful content, ignoring instructions). Check for API errors.
