# **Test Cases for Audit Logging & Security Monitoring**

## **Introduction**

This document outlines test cases for **Audit Logging & Security Monitoring** as identified in the "Risk Surface Analysis for Test Plan Section 7.3.md" (Section 3). These tests focus on ensuring that the API framework generates comprehensive, secure, and useful logs for audit purposes and security event monitoring, especially concerning LLM interactions.

* **ID:** Unique identifier  
* **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
* **Description:** What specific logging or monitoring aspect is being tested for security relevance.  
* **Exposure Point(s):** Server logs (content, format, integrity), SIEM integration (if any), alerting mechanisms.  
* **Test Method/Action:** Perform various API calls (valid, invalid, suspicious) and inspect generated logs. Review log configurations.

## **Test Cases Summary**
**Total Test Cases: 20 (Original: 10, Enhanced: +10)**

### **Log Integrity & Content**

* **ID:** AUDIT\_LOG\_TAMPERING\_001 (Difficult to test at API level, more an infra concern)  
  * **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
  * **Description:** Assess measures to ensure log integrity and prevent tampering.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** Log files on the server, centralized logging system.  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Review log management infrastructure for features like immutable storage, digital signatures for logs, or write-once media if applicable.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Access to log management system design/configuration.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Logs are stored in a way that makes tampering difficult or detectable. Centralized logging systems have strong access controls.  
  * **Verification Steps:** Review log infrastructure documentation and configurations.  
* **ID:** AUDIT\_LOG\_PII\_FILTERING\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
  * **Description:** Verify the effectiveness of PIIFilteringProcessor in redacting PII from logs. (Overlaps with EDE\_LOGS\_001 and HTTPSEC\_MIDDLEWARE\_LOGGING\_PII\_001).  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** PIIFilteringProcessor in app/logs/logging\_config.py. Server logs.  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Send API requests with known (mock) PII in prompts, user fields, or other inputs.  
  * **Prerequisites:** API running. PIIFilteringProcessor is active.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Logs at INFO level should have the mock PII redacted or replaced with placeholders by the PIIFilteringProcessor.  
  * **Verification Steps:**  
    1. Make requests containing mock PII (e.g., "My email is test@example.com, phone 555-1234").  
    2. Inspect server logs (e.g., StructlogMiddleware logs, billing logs) to confirm PII is filtered as expected. (Note: The current PIIFilteringProcessor is a placeholder and needs implementation for this test to be meaningful).  
* **ID:** AUDIT\_LOG\_SENSITIVE\_PROMPT\_RESPONSE\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
  * **Description:** Confirm that full sensitive LLM prompts and responses are not logged at INFO level in production. (Overlaps with EDE\_LOGS\_001).  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** StructlogMiddleware logs, provider interaction logs. LOG\_LEVEL configuration.  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Make chat/embedding requests. Review logs.  
  * **Prerequisites:** API running with LOG\_LEVEL=INFO.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** INFO level logs should not contain the full text of user prompts or LLM completions. Metadata (like token counts, model ID, request\_id) is acceptable. (Current StructlogMiddleware does not log request/response bodies by default).  
  * **Verification Steps:** Inspect logs to confirm absence of full prompt/response content.  
* **ID:** AUDIT\_LOG\_RAW\_APIKEY\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
  * **Description:** Ensure raw API keys are never logged. (Same as DE\_LOGGING\_005).  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** All server logs.  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Make requests with a known API key. Search logs for the key.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Valid API key. Log access.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Raw API key string is not found in any log. api\_key.id (integer PK) or api\_key.key\_prefix might be logged for tracing, which is generally acceptable if log access is controlled. request.state.api\_key\_id is logged by StructlogMiddleware.  
  * **Verification Steps:** Search logs for the plaintext API key.

### **Security Event Logging & Monitoring**

* **ID:** AUDIT\_LOG\_AUTH\_FAILURES\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
  * **Description:** Verify that failed authentication attempts (invalid key, expired key, inactive key) are logged with sufficient detail for security monitoring.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** Logs generated from app/auth/dependencies.py (valid\_api\_key).  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Trigger various authentication failures.  
  * **Prerequisites:** API running. Log access.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Logs should record:  
    * Timestamp.  
    * Source IP.  
    * Attempted endpoint.  
    * Reason for auth failure (e.g., "invalid\_token", "expired\_token", "inactive\_token").  
    * request\_id.  
    * Partial key identifier if safe (e.g., key\_prefix or api\_key.id if lookup occurred).  
    * The valid\_api\_key function logs api\_key.id to request.state if key is found, which StructlogMiddleware then logs. It doesn't explicitly log the *reason* for auth failure if the key is not found or invalid before lookup. This could be an enhancement.  
  * **Verification Steps:** Inspect logs after triggering auth failures. Check for relevant contextual information.  
* **ID:** AUDIT\_LOG\_AUTHZ\_FAILURES\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
  * **Description:** Verify that authorization failures (insufficient scope) are logged.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** Logs generated from app/auth/dependencies.py (RequiresScope).  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Attempt to access an endpoint with an API key that is valid but lacks the required scope.  
  * **Prerequisites:** API key with insufficient scope. Log access.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Logs should record:  
    * Timestamp, Source IP, Endpoint, request\_id.  
    * Authenticated API key identifier (api\_key.id via request.state).  
    * Required scope(s) and scopes present on the key.  
    * Outcome: "Authorization Denied".  
    * RequiresScope currently raises HTTPException directly. The logging of the details would come from StructlogMiddleware capturing the 401/403. Explicit logging of "authz\_denied\_required\_scope\_X\_actual\_scope\_Y" could be added.  
  * **Verification Steps:** Inspect logs after triggering authorization failure.  
* **ID:** AUDIT\_LOG\_PROVIDER\_ERRORS\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
  * **Description:** Verify that errors received from downstream LLM providers are logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting and security analysis (e.g., unusual error patterns from provider).

  * **Test Method/Action:** Mock a provider to return an error.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Mocking capability. Log access.

    * request\_id.  
    * Which provider/model was called.  
    * The error code and message received from the provider.  
    * (Current code in app/providers/bedrock/bedrock.py and app/providers/vertex\_ai/vertexai.py logs exceptions with log.exception(e) which includes stack trace and message).  
  * **Verification Steps:** Trigger provider error, inspect server logs.  
* **ID:** AUDIT\_LOG\_HIGH\_RISK\_PROMPTS\_001 (Advanced/Conceptual)  
  * **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
  * **Description:** If a mechanism exists to flag high-risk prompts (e.g., containing keywords related to PII, hate speech, or known injection patterns), verify these are logged for review.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** Hypothetical prompt analysis/filtering module. Logs.  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Send prompts containing flagged keywords.  
  * **Prerequisites:** High-risk prompt detection mechanism.

  * **Verification Steps:** Inspect logs for flagged prompts. (This is not currently implemented).  
* **ID:** AUDIT\_LOG\_SIEM\_INTEGRATION\_001 (If applicable)  
  * **Category Ref:** AuditLog \- Security Monitoring  
  * **Description:** Verify that security-relevant logs are correctly formatted and forwarded to a centralized SIEM/log management system.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** Logging pipeline, SIEM system.
