## **General Test Case Components Template**

* **ID:** Unique identifier  
* **Category Ref:** API8:2023 \- Security Misconfiguration  
* **Description:** What specific misconfiguration is being tested.  
* **Exposure Point(s):** Application server settings (debug modes, error verbosity), HTTP headers, CORS policy, logging configuration, IAM roles for cloud providers, default credentials.  
* **Test Method/Action:** Review configurations, send specific requests to check headers/error messages, attempt to access debug endpoints.  
* **Prerequisites:** Access to production-like deployment environment, configuration files, and potentially cloud console.  
* **Expected Secure Outcome:** Secure configurations are in place, debug modes are off in production, error messages are not overly verbose, CORS policy is restrictive, sensitive information is not logged at inappropriate levels, and cloud permissions adhere to least privilege.  
* **Verification Steps:** Inspect configurations, HTTP responses, server logs, and cloud IAM policies.

## **Test Cases**

* **ID:** SMISC\_DEBUG\_MODE\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** API8:2023 \- Security Misconfiguration  
  * **Description:** Verify that FastAPI debug mode is disabled in production environments.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** FastAPI application initialization in app/main.py:45, Uvicorn startup configuration, debug parameter settings.  
  * **Test Method/Action:**  
    1. Review production deployment scripts/configurations to ensure debug=True is not set for FastAPI and Uvicorn is not run with \--reload or \--debug.  
    2. Attempt to trigger an unhandled exception in a production-like environment.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Access to production/staging deployment configurations.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** FastAPI debug mode is False. Uvicorn runs without debug/reload flags. Unhandled exceptions result in the generic 500 JSON response from app/main.py\#json\_500\_handler, not a detailed FastAPI debug page.  
  * **Verification Steps:**  
    1. Confirm startup commands/configurations.  
    2. Verify that an unhandled error (if safely triggerable) yields the generic 500 response, not a debug page with stack traces.  
  * **Code Reference:** FastAPI instantiation in app/main.py:45, json_500_handler at lines 84-99.  
* **ID:** SMISC\_ERROR\_VERBOSITY\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** API8:2023 \- Security Misconfiguration  
  * **Description:** Verify that error messages (especially 500 errors) do not leak internal LLM provider details or excessive system information.  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** json_500_handler in app/main.py:84-99, error handling in provider adapters, exception response formatting.  
  * **Test Method/Action:** Trigger a 500 error by mocking a downstream LLM provider call to raise an unexpected exception.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Valid API key. Ability to mock provider SDK calls.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** Client receives {"detail": "Internal Server Error", "request\_id": "\<uuid\>"}. No raw exception messages from provider SDKs, internal variable names, or stack traces are included in the client response.  
  * **Verification Steps:**  
    1. Trigger a simulated provider error leading to a 500\.  
    2. Inspect the HTTP response body.  
    3. Check server logs for the detailed error (which is appropriate for server-side logs) and correlate with request\_id.  
  * **Code Reference:** json_500_handler in app/main.py:84-99, response content at lines 95-98, request_id_ctx usage.  
* **ID:** SMISC\_CORS\_POLICY\_001  
  * **Category Ref:** API8:2023 \- Security Misconfiguration  
  * **Description:** Verify CORS policy in app/main.py is not overly permissive in production (e.g., allow\_origins=\["\*"\] with allow\_credentials=True).  
  * **Exposure Point(s):** CORSMiddleware configuration in app/main.py:49-55, origins list at lines 40-44, allow_credentials setting at line 52.  
  * **Test Method/Action:**  
    1. Review origins list in app/main.py.  
    2. Send an OPTIONS preflight request and a GET request from an untrusted origin (e.g., using curl with a fake Origin header) to a production-like API deployment.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Production-like deployment.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** For production, allow\_origins should be a specific list of trusted domains. If allow\_credentials=True (current setting), Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header must NOT be \*. It should reflect the specific trusted origin if the request origin is in the allowlist, or not be present/access denied if origin is not allowed.  
  * **Verification Steps:**  
    1. Inspect origins in app/main.py. (Current code has "\*" which is a misconfiguration if allow\_credentials=True for production).  
    2. Send request with Origin: https://untrusted.com.  
    3. If allow\_credentials=True, the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in response should not be \*. If the untrusted origin is not in the explicit allowlist, the request might be blocked or the CORS headers might not indicate allowance.  
  * **Code Reference:** CORSMiddleware configuration in app/main.py:49-55, origins list at lines 40-44, SECURITY ISSUE: "*" origin with allow_credentials=True.  
* **ID:** SMISC\_LOG\_LEVEL\_001

  * **Test Method/Action:** Static code analysis and manual review. Search for common secret patterns.  
  * **Prerequisites:** Access to source code.  
  * **Expected Secure Outcome:** All secrets are loaded from environment variables or .env file via pydantic-settings in app/config/settings.py. No secrets appear directly in .py files.  
  * **Verification Steps:** Review settings.py to ensure sensitive fields use Field(default=...) or similar to indicate they must be provided by the environment. Search codebase for hardcoded credential patterns.  
* **ID:** SMISC\_ENV\_FILE\_SECURITY\_001
