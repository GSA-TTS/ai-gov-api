## Risk Surface: Handling of Partial Failures in Streams

* **ID:** TC_R753_PARTIAL_001
* **Category Ref:** R753_STREAMING_RELIABILITY
* **Description:** Verify API behavior when the provider connection drops or sends an error mid-stream.
* **Exposure Point(s):** `/api/v1/chat/completions` (stream: true). Provider streaming logic (e.g., `app/providers/vertex_ai/vertexai.py:107-121`). FastAPI SSE Handling.
* **Test Method/Action:** Initiate a streaming chat request. Simulate the LLM provider:
    1.  Dropping the connection abruptly after sending some chunks.
    2.  Sending an error message/object as part of the stream.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to mock provider behavior mid-stream.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The client stream terminates cleanly. The API does not hang or crash. Client receives an indication of incomplete/errored stream (e.g., error in last chunk, or specific SSE event). Server-side resources related to the stream are released.
* **Verification Steps:** Observe client-side stream termination. Check response for error signals. Check server logs for error handling and resource cleanup (e.g., no orphaned generators).

* **ID:** TC_R753_PARTIAL_002
* **Category Ref:** R753_STREAMING_RELIABILITY
* **Description:** Verify handling of network interruptions between API and provider, or API and client, during streaming.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Network connection management in provider SDKs and FastAPI.
* **Test Method/Action:** Initiate a stream. Simulate:
    1.  Temporary network glitch between API and provider.
    2.  Temporary network glitch between API and client.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to simulate network interruptions (e.g., using network tools like `tc` or by briefly interrupting connectivity for the API container).
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** For brief interruptions, the stream might pause and resume if underlying protocols support it (less likely for SSE without custom client/server logic). For longer interruptions, the stream should terminate cleanly, similar to TC_R753_PARTIAL_001. Significant data loss (missing chunks) should not occur silently if the stream continues.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor the integrity of received stream data. Check for clean termination upon prolonged interruption.

* **ID:** TC_R753_PARTIAL_003
* **Category Ref:** R753_STREAMING_RELIABILITY
* **Description:** Verify server-side resource cleanup when a client disconnects abruptly during a stream.
* **Exposure Point(s):** FastAPI `StreamingResponse` handling. Resource management in stream generators (`app/providers/vertex_ai/vertexai.py` try...finally blocks). Provider SDK connection management.
* **Test Method/Action:** Initiate a streaming request. Abruptly close the client connection (e.g., kill the client process) while the server is still sending data.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Server-side resources (connections to the LLM provider, memory for stream context, generator tasks) are promptly released. No continued processing or billing for a stream whose client is gone.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor server resources (connections, memory, tasks) after client disconnection. Check logs for generator cleanup and provider connection release.

* **ID:** TC_R753_PARTIAL_004
* **Category Ref:** R753_STREAMING_RELIABILITY
* **Description:** Verify that stream error propagation correctly terminates streams with error signals to clients.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Exception logging and handling in stream generators (e.g., `app/providers/vertex_ai/vertexai.py:120`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Induce an exception within the stream generation logic on the server side (after some chunks have been sent).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to mock/induce an exception within the provider's stream processing.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The stream is terminated, and an error signal (e.g., a specially formatted SSE error event or a non-200 status if error occurs before headers sent) is propagated to the client. The client should not perceive the stream as successfully completed.
* **Verification Steps:** Inspect the client-received stream for an error indication. Check server logs for the handled exception.

## Risk Surface: Stream Quality and Integrity

* **ID:** TC_R753_QUALITY_001
* **Category Ref:** R753_STREAMING_RELIABILITY
* **Description:** Verify that streamed chunks are delivered in the correct order and without duplication.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Provider SDK streaming logic (e.g., `app/providers/vertex_ai/vertexai.py:114`). Adapter logic for chunk conversion. FastAPI SSE handling.
* **Test Method/Action:** Initiate a streaming request for a moderately long response. Collect all received chunks on the client side.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. LLM model that produces multi-chunk responses.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Chunks are received in the correct sequence, and no chunks are duplicated. The reassembled message is coherent.
* **Verification Steps:** Reconstruct the full message from chunks and verify its integrity and order.

* **ID:** TC_R753_QUALITY_002
* **Category Ref:** R753_STREAMING_RELIABILITY
* **Description:** Verify that streams terminate completely and correctly (e.g., with a finish_reason or final [DONE] marker if applicable to the format).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Stream generation logic, adapter logic (e.g. `app/providers/open_ai/adapter_from_core.py convert_core_stream_openai` for SSE format). FastAPI stream termination.
* **Test Method/Action:** Initiate a streaming request and let it complete normally.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The stream includes a clear end-of-stream indication (e.g., `finish_reason` in the final data chunk, or a `[DONE]` message as per OpenAI SSE format). The connection is closed cleanly.
* **Verification Steps:** Inspect the final chunks/events of the stream for the correct termination signal.

* **ID:** TC_R753_QUALITY_003
* **Category Ref:** R753_STREAMING_RELIABILITY
* **Description:** Verify that individual SSE events and their data payloads conform to the expected schema (e.g., Core `ChatCompletionChunk`).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Adapter logic transforming provider chunks to the core schema (e.g., `app/providers/vertex_ai/adapter_to_core.py vertex_stream_response_to_core`). OpenAI format conversion (`app/providers/open_ai/adapter_from_core.py`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Initiate a streaming request. Inspect the structure and content of individual received SSE events/chunks.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Each SSE event is well-formed. The `data` payload of each event is valid JSON and conforms to the `ChatCompletionChunk` schema (or the relevant embedding stream schema if applicable).
* **Verification Steps:** Parse each SSE event and validate its data payload against the defined schema.

* **ID:** TC_R753_QUALITY_004
* **Category Ref:** R753_STREAMING_RELIABILITY
* **Description:** Verify timeout handling for idle streams (if the provider or client stops sending/receiving data).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Streaming logic, FastAPI/Uvicorn timeout settings.
* **Test Method/Action:**
    1. Simulate a provider that starts a stream but then stops sending chunks for an extended period.
    2. Simulate a client that connects for a stream but stops reading data from the socket.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to simulate provider or client becoming idle during a stream.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Idle streams are eventually timed out by the server (either API or web server like Uvicorn) to prevent resource leakage. The connection is closed.
* **Verification Steps:** Observe that the connection is eventually closed. Check server logs for timeout events and resource cleanup.

* **ID:** TC_R753_QUALITY_005
* **Category Ref:** R753_STREAMING_RELIABILITY
* **Description:** Verify handling of error chunks when mid-stream failures occur.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Stream generation and error handling logic.
* **Test Method/Action:** Induce a recoverable error mid-stream that the API intends to signal to the client via an error chunk/event.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Mechanism to send structured error information within the stream.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** If a mid-stream error occurs and is handled, an error chunk/event is sent in the standardized format, and the stream is then properly terminated.
* **Verification Steps:** Inspect the stream for a correctly formatted error chunk/event. Verify the stream terminates afterwards.
