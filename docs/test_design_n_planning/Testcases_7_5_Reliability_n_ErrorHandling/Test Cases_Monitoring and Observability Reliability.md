## Risk Surface: Logging Infrastructure Reliability

* **ID:** TC_R759_LOGGING_001
* **Category Ref:** R759_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY
* **Description:** Verify logging infrastructure operates reliably without loss of critical debugging and monitoring information.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Structured logging (`app/logs/middleware.py`), logging config (`app/logs/logging_config.py`), context management (`app/logs/logging_context.py`). External logging dependencies.
* **Test Method/Action:** Generate high load on the API, including requests that produce various log messages (info, errors, provider metrics).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Logging is configured (e.g., to console and/or external system).
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** All log messages are processed and stored/displayed correctly without loss, even under load. The logging system itself does not crash or become a bottleneck. (Current analysis notes: "No evidence of fallback logging mechanisms").
* **Verification Steps:** Check log outputs (console, files, external system) for completeness and correctness. Monitor API performance to ensure logging is not causing significant overhead. Simulate failure of external logging system (if used) and check if API continues to function and if local/fallback logging works.

* **ID:** TC_R759_LOGGING_002
* **Category Ref:** R759_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY
* **Description:** Verify request context (`request_id`, etc.) is properly propagated through async operations and present in all relevant logs.
* **Exposure Point(s):** `app/logs/logging_context.py`, async request handlers, background tasks.
* **Test Method/Action:** Make requests that involve multiple asynchronous operations or background tasks (e.g., a streaming call that also queues a billing event).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The initial `request_id` and other relevant context variables are present in all log messages generated throughout the lifecycle of that request, including in async tasks spawned by it.
* **Verification Steps:** Trace a single request's `request_id` through various log entries, including those from different threads or async contexts.

* **ID:** TC_R759_LOGGING_003
* **Category Ref:** R759_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY
* **Description:** Assess performance impact of logging on application latency.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Logging middleware, frequency and volume of logging.
* **Test Method/Action:**
    1. Measure baseline API latency with minimal logging.
    2. Enable verbose/debug logging and re-measure latency under similar load.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to configure log levels. Performance testing tools. (Current analysis: "No visible monitoring of logging infrastructure performance impact").
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Logging overhead is minimal and does not significantly contribute to latency SLO breaches under normal log levels. Verbose logging's impact is understood.
* **Verification Steps:** Compare latency measurements between different log level configurations.

* **ID:** TC_R759_LOGGING_004

* **Test Method/Action:** Run the API under high load for an extended period with typical logging enabled.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.

* **Verification Steps:** Monitor log file sizes or log ingestion rates. Check for disk space alerts. Assess performance.

* **ID:** TC_R759_LOGGING_005
* **Category Ref:** R759_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY

* **Test Method/Action:** Collect sample logs from various operations and components.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** All log entries adhere to a consistent structured format (e.g., JSON with standard fields like timestamp, level, message, request_id, and other contextual data).
* **Verification Steps:** Inspect log samples for format consistency. Attempt to parse logs with automated tools.

## Risk Surface: Metrics Collection and Monitoring System Reliability

* **Category Ref:** R759_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY
* **Description:** Verify reliability of metrics collection (application metrics, provider metrics, health metrics) without blind spots.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Metrics collection points (e.g., `app/providers/vertex_ai/vertexai.py:80, 99, 116` for provider metrics). Health check `app/routers/root.py`. Integration with external monitoring systems. (Current analysis: "Limited Coverage", "No External Integration" for alerting/viz).

* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Metrics collection is implemented.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Metrics are reliably collected for all relevant events. Failures in an external monitoring system do not cause the API to fail or significantly degrade. Fallback or local logging of metrics might occur.

* **Verification Steps:** Manually reconcile metrics data with test inputs and observed outcomes.

* **ID:** TC_R759_METRICS_003
* **Category Ref:** R759_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY

* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to control metrics collection if possible. Performance testing tools.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Metrics collection has minimal and acceptable performance overhead, not breaching latency SLOs.
* **Verification Steps:** Compare latency measurements with and without (or with varied levels of) metrics collection.

* **ID:** TC_R759_METRICS_004
* **Category Ref:** R759_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY
* **Description:** Verify temporal consistency of metrics (e.g., timing issues affecting accuracy of latency/error rates).
* Exposure Point(s): Timestamping of metrics, aggregation windows in monitoring.
* **Test Method/Action:** Send bursts of requests and observe if the metrics reflect these bursts accurately in time. For latency, compare reported metrics with client-side measured latency.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Monitoring system displays time-series data.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Metrics are timestamped correctly and reflect events in near real-time or with known, acceptable delay. Aggregated metrics (like per-minute error rates) are accurate for their time windows.
* **Verification Steps:** Correlate event occurrences with metric reporting times.

* **ID:** TC_R759_METRICS_005
* **Category Ref:** R759_MONITORING_OBSERVABILITY
* **Description:** Verify reliability of alerts generated from metrics (if monitoring system and alerts are set up).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Alerting rules in the monitoring system based on collected metrics.

* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Monitoring system integrated and alert rules configured.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Alerts are reliably delivered when defined thresholds are breached. False positives are minimal. Alerts are not missed for actual qualifying events.
* **Verification Steps:** Check if alerts are received via the configured channels (email, PagerDuty, etc.). Verify timing and accuracy of alert conditions.
