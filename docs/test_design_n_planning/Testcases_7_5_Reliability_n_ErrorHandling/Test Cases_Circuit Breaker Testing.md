## Risk Surface: Circuit Breaker State Transitions and Behavior

* **ID:** TC_R755_CIRCUIT_001
* **Category Ref:** R755_CIRCUIT_BREAKER
* **Description:** Verify the circuit opens when failure thresholds (error rates, latencies) are met for an LLM provider.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Hypothetical circuit breaker implementation (e.g., pybreaker) wrapping LLM provider calls. Configuration of thresholds. Endpoints: `/api/v1/chat/completions`, `/api/v1/embeddings`.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a high rate of errors or excessive latency from a specific LLM provider/model, exceeding the configured circuit breaker threshold.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Circuit breaker logic implemented and configured for a provider/model. Ability to simulate provider failures.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The circuit breaker for that provider/model transitions to the "OPEN" state. Subsequent requests to this provider/model are failed fast by the circuit breaker.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor circuit breaker state (e.g., via logs or metrics if exposed). Observe that subsequent requests receive immediate errors (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable) without attempting to call the failing provider.

* **ID:** TC_R755_CIRCUIT_002
* **Category Ref:** R755_CIRCUIT_BREAKER
* **Description:** Verify the circuit transitions to "HALF-OPEN" state after the configured timeout.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Circuit breaker's reset timeout configuration.
* **Test Method/Action:** After the circuit is OPEN, wait for the configured reset timeout period. Send a new request to the affected provider/model.
* **Prerequisites:** Circuit is in OPEN state.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The circuit breaker transitions to "HALF-OPEN". The next request (or a limited number of requests) is allowed through to the provider.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor circuit breaker state. Observe that a test request is attempted to the provider.

* **ID:** TC_R755_CIRCUIT_003
* **Category Ref:** R755_CIRCUIT_BREAKER
* **Description:** Verify the circuit transitions to "CLOSED" state if requests in "HALF-OPEN" state succeed.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Circuit breaker logic for success handling in HALF-OPEN state.
* **Test Method/Action:** While the circuit is HALF-OPEN, ensure the test request(s) to the provider succeed. Then send further requests.
* **Prerequisites:** Circuit is in HALF-OPEN state. Provider is now responding successfully.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The circuit breaker transitions to "CLOSED" state. Normal request processing resumes for that provider/model.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor circuit breaker state. Observe that subsequent requests are processed normally by the provider.

* **ID:** TC_R755_CIRCUIT_004
* **Category Ref:** R755_CIRCUIT_BREAKER
* **Description:** Verify the circuit transitions back to "OPEN" state if requests in "HALF-OPEN" state fail.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Circuit breaker logic for failure handling in HALF-OPEN state.
* **Test Method/Action:** While the circuit is HALF-OPEN, ensure the test request(s) to the provider fail.
* **Prerequisites:** Circuit is in HALF-OPEN state. Provider is still failing.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The circuit breaker transitions back to "OPEN" state. The reset timeout starts again.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor circuit breaker state. Observe that subsequent requests are again failed fast.

* **ID:** TC_R755_CIRCUIT_005
* **Category Ref:** R755_CIRCUIT_BREAKER
* **Description:** Verify that the API fails fast with an appropriate error (e.g., 503) when the circuit is OPEN.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Circuit breaker's fast-fail response mechanism.
* **Test Method/Action:** Send requests to a provider/model for which the circuit is OPEN.
* **Prerequisites:** Circuit is in OPEN state.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API immediately returns an error (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable) without attempting to contact the unhealthy provider. Response time is very low.
* **Verification Steps:** Check API response status code and body. Measure response time.

* **ID:** TC_R755_CIRCUIT_006
* **Category Ref:** R755_CIRCUIT_BREAKER
* **Description:** Verify circuit breaker behavior with different threshold configurations (too sensitive vs. too insensitive - conceptual validation of configuration).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Circuit breaker threshold configurations.
* **Test Method/Action:**
    1. Set very low error/latency thresholds and simulate minor, infrequent issues.
    2. Set very high error/latency thresholds and simulate significant provider degradation.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Circuit breaker implemented with configurable thresholds.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:**
    1. With sensitive thresholds, the circuit opens quickly even for minor issues.
    2. With insensitive thresholds, the circuit only opens during major, prolonged outages.
    (This test is about validating the impact of configuration).
* **Verification Steps:** Observe circuit breaker behavior under different threshold settings and simulated load/error patterns.

* **ID:** TC_R755_CIRCUIT_007
* **Category Ref:** R755_CIRCUIT_BREAKER
* **Description:** Verify granularity of circuit breakers (e.g., per provider, per model, or per specific provider endpoint).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Implementation scope of individual circuit breakers.
* **Test Method/Action:** If circuits are per-model: Induce failure for one model of a provider. Check if other models from the same provider are affected. If circuits are per-provider: Induce failure for one model of a provider. Check if all models from that provider are affected.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Circuit breaker logic implemented. Understanding of how circuits are applied.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Failures are isolated according to the circuit breaker's granularity. An issue with one model (if circuits are per-model) should not open the circuit for other models, even on the same provider.
* **Verification Steps:** Test requests to different models/providers while a specific circuit is expected to be open.

* **ID:** TC_R755_CIRCUIT_008
* **Category Ref:** R755_CIRCUIT_BREAKER
* **Description:** Verify integration of circuit breaker with provider failover logic (if both are implemented).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Interaction between circuit breaker and failover mechanisms.
* **Test Method/Action:** Configure a primary provider with a circuit breaker and a secondary/fallback provider. Trip the circuit for the primary provider.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Both circuit breaker and provider failover logic are implemented and configured.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** When the circuit for the primary provider opens, the system correctly triggers a switch to the fallback provider (if configured and healthy).
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor circuit breaker state and logs for failover initiation. Verify requests are routed to the fallback provider.
