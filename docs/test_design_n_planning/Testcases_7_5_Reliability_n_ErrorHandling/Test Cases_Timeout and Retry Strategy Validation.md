## Risk Surface: Timeout Configuration and Enforcement

* **ID:** TC_R754_TIMEOUT_001
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify provider connection/read timeouts are configured and trigger appropriately.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Provider SDK timeout configurations (e.g., in `app/providers/vertex_ai/vertexai.py` initialization for `GenerativeModel`, Bedrock `botocore.config.Config`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a downstream LLM provider that accepts a connection but then fails to respond (or responds very slowly, exceeding configured read timeout).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Explicit timeout configurations are set for providers. Ability to mock provider to simulate no response or slow response.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API request to the provider times out after the configured duration. The API returns a clear error message to the client (e.g., 504 Gateway Timeout), rather than hanging indefinitely or returning a generic server timeout from Uvicorn before the provider timeout.
* **Verification Steps:** Measure response time. Inspect API response for 504 status and appropriate message. Check logs for provider timeout exception handling.

* **ID:** TC_R754_TIMEOUT_002
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify that API-level timeouts (e.g., Uvicorn) do not prematurely terminate requests before specific provider timeouts are hit and handled.
* **Exposure Point(s):** FastAPI/Uvicorn server-level timeout settings vs. provider SDK timeout settings.
* **Test Method/Action:** Configure a provider timeout to be shorter than the Uvicorn server timeout. Simulate a provider taking longer than its specific timeout but less than the Uvicorn timeout.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Configurable Uvicorn and provider timeouts.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API handles the provider-specific timeout and returns a relevant error (e.g., 504), not a generic Uvicorn timeout.
* **Verification Steps:** Check the error message source in the API response and logs to ensure it's from the application's provider timeout handling.

* **ID:** TC_R754_TIMEOUT_003
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify timeout handling for idle streaming responses (as also covered in 7.5.3 but specifically for timeout configuration).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Streaming logic, provider SDK stream timeout settings (if any), server-level idle timeouts.
* **Test Method/Action:** Initiate a stream where the provider stops sending data for longer than any configured idle timeout.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Idle timeout for streams is configured (either in API, provider SDK, or server).
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The idle stream is terminated by a timeout, and resources are released. Client connection is closed.
* **Verification Steps:** Observe stream termination. Check server logs for idle timeout events.

* **ID:** TC_R754_TIMEOUT_004
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify database operation timeout configuration and handling.
* **Exposure Point(s):** SQLAlchemy async session timeout configuration (`app/db/session.py`).
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a database query that takes longer than the configured database timeout.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Database timeout is configured. Ability to make a DB query hang.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The database operation times out. The API handles this gracefully, logs the error, and returns an appropriate error response (e.g., 503 or 500 with details in logs) rather than hanging indefinitely.
* **Verification Steps:** Check API response and server logs for database timeout handling.

## Risk Surface: Retry Strategy Logic and Effectiveness

* **ID:** TC_R754_RETRY_001
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify that the API (or underlying SDKs) retries on transient provider errors.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Retry mechanisms within provider SDKs (e.g., botocore for Bedrock) or custom retry logic in API framework.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a transient error from an LLM provider (e.g., a single 503 error, a temporary network blip that the SDK is configured to retry on).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Retry strategies are enabled and configured in SDKs or application. Ability to mock provider to return a transient error once, then succeed.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The initial transient error is logged (if applicable). The request is automatically retried and eventually succeeds. The client receives a successful response.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor server logs for evidence of retries. Confirm client receives a successful response after initial simulated transient error.

* **ID:** TC_R754_RETRY_002
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify that excessive retries are not performed, and that retries eventually stop, returning an error to the client.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Retry configuration (max attempts).
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a persistent transient error from an LLM provider (e.g., provider consistently returns a retryable error).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Retry strategy with a defined maximum number of attempts. Ability to mock provider for persistent retryable errors.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API retries up to the configured maximum number of attempts. After exhausting retries, it returns an appropriate error message (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable or 504 Gateway Timeout) to the client.
* **Verification Steps:** Check server logs for the number of retries. Verify client receives an error after max retries are exhausted.

* **ID:** TC_R754_RETRY_003
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify that retries are not attempted for non-transient (e.g., 4xx) provider errors.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Retry logic conditions (should only retry on specific error types/codes).
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a non-transient error from the provider (e.g., a 400 Bad Request from the provider due to an invalid parameter passed by GSAi, or a 401 from the provider).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Retry logic configured to differentiate error types.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API does not retry on non-transient provider errors. It maps the error and returns it to the client promptly.
* **Verification Steps:** Check server logs for absence of retries for these error types. Client receives the mapped error quickly.

* **ID:** TC_R754_RETRY_004
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify that Retry-After headers from providers are respected if retry logic is application-aware.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Custom retry logic (if SDKs don't handle this automatically).
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a provider error that includes a `Retry-After` header (e.g., a 429 Too Many Requests).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Application or SDK is capable of parsing `Retry-After`. Ability to mock provider response with this header.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API (or SDK) waits for the duration specified in the `Retry-After` header before attempting the next retry.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor server logs for retry attempts and observe the delay between them, corresponding to the `Retry-After` value.

* **ID:** TC_R754_RETRY_005
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify implementation of exponential backoff and jitter in retry strategies.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Retry mechanism configuration in SDKs or custom logic.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a provider error that triggers multiple retries.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Exponential backoff and jitter are configured.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The delay between retry attempts increases exponentially, and jitter is applied to spread out retry attempts.
* **Verification Steps:** Analyze timestamps of retry attempts in server logs to confirm adherence to exponential backoff and jitter patterns.

* **ID:** TC_R754_RETRY_006
* **Category Ref:** R754_TIMEOUT_RETRY
* **Description:** Verify billing implications of retry mechanisms for LLM calls.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Billing service integration (`app/services/billing.py`), retry logic.
* **Test Method/Action:** Induce a scenario where a request to an LLM provider is retried and eventually succeeds.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Retry logic is active. Billing is being recorded.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Billing reflects only one successful LLM call, or if failed attempts are billable by the provider and GSAi intends to pass this on, it's documented and handled as expected. Typically, only the successful call (or the final failed one if all retries fail) should be the primary billed event from GSAi's perspective unless GSAi itself incurs costs for failed attempts it chooses to retry.
* **Verification Steps:** Check billing records for the request. Ensure no duplicate charges for the same logical request due to retries of transient issues that eventually succeed.
