## Risk Surface: API Availability and Success Rate

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_AVAIL_001
* **Category Ref:** R757_SLO_VALIDATION
* **Description:** Measure API availability over a period under normal and stress conditions to validate against SLOs.
* **Exposure Point(s):** All API endpoints, especially core LLM endpoints. Entire application and dependencies.
* **Test Method/Action:** Run a sustained load test over an extended period (e.g., hours). Continuously monitor endpoint health and successful response rates (e.g., non-5xx responses). Induce controlled transient failures (e.g., brief DB disconnect, short provider hiccup) to test recovery.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running in a production-like environment. Defined availability SLO (e.g., 99.9%). Monitoring tools to measure uptime and success rate. Load testing tools. (Current analysis notes: "Missing automated recovery patterns", "Limited health check coverage").
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Measured availability and success rates meet or exceed the defined SLOs. The system recovers from transient issues within the SLO recovery time objective (RTO).
* **Verification Steps:** Collect availability and success rate metrics from monitoring tools. Compare against SLO targets. Analyze periods of unavailability or high error rates to identify causes.

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_AVAIL_002
* **Category Ref:** R757_SLO_VALIDATION
* **Description:** Validate that high rates of errors (5xx, or 4xx if due to API misbehavior) are detected and would impact success rate SLOs and error budgets.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Error handling, monitoring infrastructure (`app/logs/middleware.py` for request correlation, but "lacks comprehensive SLO metrics collection").
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate scenarios causing a high rate of specific errors:
    1.  Persistent 5xx errors (e.g., a misconfigured downstream dependency).
    2.  High rate of 4xx errors that might indicate an API issue (e.g., incorrect validation logic leading to false positives, frequent auth failures due to a bug).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Defined success rate SLO and error budget. Monitoring for error rates.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Monitoring systems accurately track these error rates. The increase in errors is shown to consume the error budget and potentially breach success rate SLOs. Alerts are triggered if configured.
* **Verification Steps:** Check monitoring dashboards for error rate spikes. Verify if SLO tracking mechanisms (if any) reflect the impact.

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_AVAIL_003
* **Category Ref:** R757_SLO_VALIDATION
* **Description:** Verify the accuracy of availability and success rate measurements.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Monitoring and logging systems. Health check logic.
* **Test Method/Action:** Perform a series of known successful requests and known failed requests (both client and server errors). Compare the counts and classifications in the monitoring system with the actual test execution. Induce a short, controlled downtime.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Monitoring system in place.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The monitoring system accurately records the number of successful requests, failed requests (correctly categorized), and the period of downtime. These measurements correctly reflect the API's actual state.
* **Verification Steps:** Compare monitoring data against test execution logs and known events.

## Risk Surface: Latency SLOs

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_LATENCY_001
* **Category Ref:** R757_SLO_VALIDATION
* **Description:** Measure API response times (including TTFT for streams, total time for non-streaming) under various load conditions to validate against latency SLOs (e.g., p95, p99).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Entire request-response path. Provider interaction, database queries, internal processing. (Current analysis notes: "basic latency metrics but lacks percentile tracking", "Missing comprehensive end-to-end latency measurement", "TTFT metrics not implemented").
* **Test Method/Action:** Run load tests with varying concurrency levels. For chat completions, test both streaming (`stream: true`) and non-streaming requests. Measure:
    * End-to-end latency for non-streaming requests.
    * Time To First Token (TTFT) for streaming requests.
    * Total stream duration for streaming requests.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Defined latency SLOs (e.g., p95 < 500ms for non-streaming, p95 TTFT < 200ms for streaming). Load testing and performance measurement tools.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Measured latencies (p50, p90, p95, p99) meet the defined SLO targets under expected load conditions.
* **Verification Steps:** Collect latency percentile data from test tools/monitoring. Compare against SLO targets. Identify endpoints or conditions that cause SLO breaches.

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_LATENCY_002
* **Category Ref:** R757_SLO_VALIDATION
* **Description:** Identify and analyze high tail latencies (e.g., p99.9) that significantly impact a subset of users.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Request processing path, resource contention points.
* **Test Method/Action:** During load tests, specifically capture and analyze requests experiencing very high latencies. Attempt to correlate these with specific conditions (e.g., particular inputs, cold starts, garbage collection pauses, specific provider behavior).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Load testing tools capable of capturing detailed metrics for individual requests.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Sources of high tail latency are identified. While some tail latency is normal, there are no systemic issues causing unacceptably high p99+ latencies.
* **Verification Steps:** Analyze the distribution of latencies. Investigate outliers to find root causes.

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_LATENCY_003
* **Category Ref:** R757_SLO_VALIDATION
* **Description:** Test for performance regressions that could cause latency SLOs to be missed (requires baseline).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Code changes, configuration changes, dependency updates.
* **Test Method/Action:** Establish a performance baseline. After code/config changes, re-run standardized performance tests.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Baseline performance metrics are established. Performance testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline or run regularly. (Current analysis notes: "Missing automated detection of latency regressions").
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Latency metrics after changes do not significantly regress compared to the baseline, or any regressions are understood and acceptable. Latency SLOs continue to be met.
* **Verification Steps:** Compare current performance test results against baseline metrics.

## Risk Surface: Error Tracing and Correlation for SLO Monitoring

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_TRACE_001
* **Category Ref:** R757_SLO_VALIDATION
* **Description:** Verify consistent `request_id` propagation across logs and to downstream services (if possible) for tracing.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Logging (`app/logs/middleware.py`, `app/logs/logging_context.py`). Provider SDK calls.
* **Test Method/Action:** Make an API request that interacts with a provider. Trigger an error either in the API or simulate an error from the provider.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. (Current analysis notes: "lacks integration with provider SDK tracing", "No evidence of distributed tracing integration").
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The `request_id` generated at the API entry point is present in all relevant API logs for that request. If providers are called, and if SDKs support it and are configured, this ID (or a related trace ID) is passed to the provider and appears in provider logs (external verification might be hard).
* **Verification Steps:** Inspect API server logs for consistent `request_id`. If possible and accessible, check provider logs for a corresponding ID.

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_TRACE_002

* **Verification Steps:** Review log entries and error reports for completeness and clarity.

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_TRACE_003
* **Category Ref:** R757_SLO_VALIDATION

* **Exposure Point(s):** `request_id` in client-facing errors. Server-side logging.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a client receiving an error with a `request_id`. Use this `request_id` to search server logs.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Client error responses include `request_id`. Access to server logs.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The `request_id` from the client error can be quickly and reliably used to find detailed diagnostic information in server logs.
* **Verification Steps:** Perform the search and confirm relevant log entries are found.

* **ID:** TC_R757_SLO_TRACE_004
* **Category Ref:** R757_SLO_VALIDATION
* **Description:** Verify that logs and metrics provide enough information to attribute SLO breaches or error budget consumption to specific components or causes.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Logging content, metrics tagging/dimensions. (Current analysis notes: "Insufficient context to determine which component failures contribute most to SLO breaches").
* **Test Method/Action:** Induce failures or performance degradation in different components (e.g., a specific provider, database). Observe if logs and metrics allow pinpointing the source of the SLO impact.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Monitoring and logging are in place.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** When an SLO is breached (e.g., high latency, high error rate), analysis of logs and metrics can clearly identify the contributing component(s) (e.g., "latency SLO breached due to slow responses from Provider X," or "error rate SLO breached due to database timeouts").
* **Verification Steps:** Review metrics and logs during simulated component failures and assess if the root cause is identifiable.
