## Risk Surface: Graceful Startup and Shutdown Procedures

* **ID:** TC_R758_LIFECYCLE_001
* **Category Ref:** R758_APP_LIFECYCLE
* **Description:** Verify application starts only after validating critical dependencies like database and provider connections/configurations.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Application startup logic (`app/main.py`), DB connection init (`app/db/session.py`), provider init (e.g., `app/providers/vertex_ai/vertexai.py:61-63`). Health check `app/routers/root.py`. (Current analysis notes: "No evidence of provider credential validation or database connectivity checks during application startup").
* **Test Method/Action:**
    1. Attempt to start the API with the database service down.
    2. Attempt to start the API with invalid provider credentials in the configuration.
* **Prerequisites:** API is not running. Ability to control dependency availability (DB) and configurations (provider credentials).
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:**
    1. If DB is down, the API fails to start or starts in a degraded state clearly indicating the DB issue in logs and health check. It should not report healthy or accept requests that need DB.
    2. With invalid provider credentials, API fails to start or logs critical errors and relevant provider(s) are marked unhealthy/unavailable. It shouldn't silently proceed and then fail on first provider call.
* **Verification Steps:** Check application logs for startup errors. Check health check status immediately after startup attempt. Attempt a simple request.

* **ID:** TC_R758_LIFECYCLE_002
* **Category Ref:** R758_APP_LIFECYCLE
* **Description:** Verify graceful shutdown procedures, including processing of in-flight requests (if feasible), background task completion (billing queue), and resource cleanup.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Application signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT). Background task management (`app/services/billing.py:10-14, 17-24 drain_billing_queue`). Resource cleanup for DB/provider connections. (Current analysis notes: "Missing signal handlers", "billing_worker ... shutdown coordination not explicitly managed").
* **Test Method/Action:**
    1. Send a stream of requests to the API, including some that trigger billing.
    2. While requests are in-flight and billing items are in queue, send a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal to the API process.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to send signals to the process. Background tasks (billing) are active.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API attempts to complete in-flight requests within a timeout. The `drain_billing_queue` function is called and processes pending items. Database and provider connections are closed gracefully. No data loss for critical tasks like billing due to shutdown.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor logs for shutdown sequence, connection closures, and billing queue processing. Check billing data persistence. Check for abrupt connection drops for clients with in-flight requests.

* **ID:** TC_R758_LIFECYCLE_003
* **Category Ref:** R758_APP_LIFECYCLE
* **Description:** Verify health check readiness reporting is accurate and timed correctly (reports ready only when all critical components are functional).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Health check endpoint (`app/routers/root.py`). Startup logic. (Current analysis notes: "Health checks reporting ready before all dependencies are actually validated").
* **Test Method/Action:** During API startup, continuously poll the health check endpoint. Correlate its status with the actual initialization state of dependencies (DB, providers).
* **Prerequisites:** API is starting up.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The health check endpoint (`/health`) reports unhealthy or a specific "starting" state until all critical dependencies are confirmed to be operational. It only reports fully healthy when the API is truly ready to serve all types of requests.
* **Verification Steps:** Observe health check responses during startup. Compare with server logs indicating dependency initialization status.

* **ID:** TC_R758_LIFECYCLE_004
* **Category Ref:** R758_APP_LIFECYCLE
* **Description:** Verify that the billing queue (`drain_billing_queue`) is effectively processed during graceful shutdown.
* **Exposure Point(s):** `app/services/billing.py:17-24 drain_billing_queue`, application shutdown lifecycle.
* **Test Method/Action:** Enqueue several items into the billing queue. Initiate a graceful shutdown of the application.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Billing items are in the queue. Graceful shutdown mechanism is triggered.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** All items in the billing queue are processed and persisted before the application fully exits. No billing data is lost.
* **Verification Steps:** Check the number of items in the queue before shutdown. Verify that corresponding billing records are created/updated in the persistence layer after shutdown. Check logs for `drain_billing_queue` activity.

## Risk Surface: Configuration Reliability and Runtime Reconfiguration

* **ID:** TC_R758_CONFIG_001
* **Category Ref:** R758_APP_LIFECYCLE
* **Description:** Verify API behavior with invalid or missing critical configuration parameters at startup.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Settings management (`app/config/settings.py`). Provider configuration (e.g., `app/providers/vertex_ai/vertexai.py:56-59 VertexBackend.Settings`). Environment variables.
* **Test Method/Action:** Attempt to start the API with:
    1. Missing `vertex_project_id` (marked as required).
    2. Invalid database connection string.
    3. Malformed `settings.backend_map`.
* **Prerequisites:** API is not running. Ability to modify configuration files or environment variables.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API fails to start or starts with clear error messages in the logs indicating the configuration issue. Pydantic settings validation should catch many of these. The application should not start in a state where it's guaranteed to fail on first use due to bad config.
* **Verification Steps:** Check application startup logs for specific configuration error messages. Verify if the application process exits or remains in a non-operational state.

* **ID:** TC_R758_CONFIG_002
* **Category Ref:** R758_APP_LIFECYCLE
* **Description:** Test runtime validation of provider credentials or connectivity during application startup.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Provider initialization logic. (Current analysis: "No evidence of runtime validation of provider credentials or connectivity during application startup").
* **Test Method/Action:** Configure valid but non-functional provider credentials (e.g., correct format but wrong key, or pointing to a non-existent project). Start the application.
* **Prerequisites:** API is not running. This test assumes a startup validation check is implemented.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** If startup validation for providers is implemented, the application logs warnings or errors indicating which providers failed to connect/authenticate during startup. The health status of these providers might be affected.
* **Verification Steps:** Check startup logs for provider connection/authentication attempt results. Check health status if it includes provider health.

* **ID:** TC_R758_CONFIG_003
* **Category Ref:** R758_APP_LIFECYCLE
* **Description:** Verify handling of inappropriate default values for critical configuration parameters.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Default values in Pydantic setting models.
* **Test Method/Action:** Identify critical configuration parameters that have defaults. Assess if these defaults are safe for a non-functional or test environment, or if they could lead to unexpected behavior or connections to real services if not overridden. For example, a default timeout that is too short or too long.
* **Prerequisites:** Review code for configuration defaults.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Default values are "fail-safe" or clearly documented as needing override for production. They do not inadvertently point to live, billable services or cause immediate operational issues if not changed.
* **Verification Steps:** Code review of default settings. Test startup with minimal configuration to see which defaults apply and their impact.

* **ID:** TC_R758_CONFIG_004
* **Category Ref:** R758_APP_LIFECYCLE
* **Description:** Test behavior if dynamic configuration reloading is attempted/supported (if applicable).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Configuration loading mechanism. Any signal handlers or endpoints for reloading configuration.
* **Test Method/Action:** If dynamic reloading is a feature:
    1. Change a configuration value while the API is running (e.g., a model mapping in `settings.backend_map`).
    2. Trigger the reload mechanism.
    3. Send requests that would be affected by this change.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Dynamic configuration reloading feature exists.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Configuration is reloaded without service disruption (or with minimal, documented disruption). New requests use the updated configuration. No inconsistent behavior or crashes occur during/after reload.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor logs for reload activity. Test API behavior before and after reload to confirm changes took effect. Check for errors during reload.
