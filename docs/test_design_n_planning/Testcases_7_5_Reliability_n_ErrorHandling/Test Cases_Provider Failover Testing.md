## Risk Surface: Failover Decision Logic and Execution

* **ID:** TC_R752_FAILOVER_001
* **Category Ref:** R752_PROVIDER_FAILOVER
* **Description:** Verify correct detection of primary provider failure (based on error rates/latency) leading to a failover attempt.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Hypothetical logic monitoring primary provider health; logic to select and switch to a secondary provider (`settings.backend_map`). Endpoints: `/api/v1/chat/completions`, `/api/v1/embeddings`.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate primary provider consistently returning errors or high latency for a specific model. Make requests to that model.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Failover logic implemented. Primary and secondary providers configured for a model. Ability to simulate primary provider failure.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The system detects the primary provider's issues according to defined thresholds and attempts to switch to the configured secondary provider for the affected model.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor logs for failover decision. Check if subsequent requests for the model are routed to the secondary provider.

* **ID:** TC_R752_FAILOVER_002
* **Category Ref:** R752_PROVIDER_FAILOVER
* **Description:** Verify correct selection and switching to a secondary/fallback provider.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Failover logic, `settings.backend_map`.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate primary provider failure for a model that has a secondary provider configured.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Failover logic implemented. Correct secondary provider configured in `settings.backend_map`.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Upon primary provider failure, the API successfully switches to and uses the designated secondary provider.
* **Verification Steps:** Confirm requests are successfully processed by the secondary provider after failover. Check logs for confirmation of secondary provider selection.

* **ID:** TC_R752_FAILOVER_003
* **Category Ref:** R752_PROVIDER_FAILOVER
* **Description:** Measure latency introduced by the failover process itself.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Failover execution logic.
* **Test Method/Action:** Induce a primary provider failure and measure the time taken for the first successful request to be processed by the secondary provider, compared to normal processing times.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Failover logic implemented.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The failover process introduces minimal and acceptable latency. Service disruption is minimized.
* **Verification Steps:** Measure end-to-end latency of requests during a failover event. Compare against baseline latencies.

* **ID:** TC_R752_FAILOVER_004
* **Category Ref:** R752_PROVIDER_FAILOVER
* **Description:** Verify that non-idempotent requests are not incorrectly retried on the fallback provider if the failover happens after partial processing (if applicable).
* **Exposure Point(s):** State management during failover, retry logic within failover.
* **Test Method/Action:** If applicable (e.g., a hypothetical stateful operation), simulate a primary provider failure mid-operation, triggering failover.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Failover logic implemented. A non-idempotent operation is identified (less likely for pure inference but important if any state changes before provider call).
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Non-idempotent operations are handled safely during failover, preventing duplicate processing or billing, possibly by failing the request if atomicity cannot be guaranteed. For pure inference, retrying on fallback is generally safe.
* **Verification Steps:** Check for duplicate actions or billing entries if the request involved side effects. For inference, verify the request is simply processed by the fallback.

* **ID:** TC_R752_FAILOVER_005
* **Category Ref:** R752_PROVIDER_FAILOVER
* **Description:** Verify state (e.g., conversation history if not fully client-managed) is handled correctly during failover for multi-turn chat.
* **Exposure Point(s):** State management in failover logic (if any server-side state is maintained across turns).
* **Test Method/Action:** For a multi-turn chat session, simulate primary provider failure. Continue the chat session after failover to the secondary provider.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Failover logic implemented. Server-side conversation state management (if it exists beyond individual requests).
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Conversation context is maintained (or correctly re-established if client-managed) when switching to a fallback provider. The secondary provider can continue the conversation meaningfully.
* **Verification Steps:** Observe the chat session's coherence and correctness after failover.

* **ID:** TC_R752_FAILOVER_006
* **Category Ref:** R752_PROVIDER_FAILOVER
* **Description:** Test for "flapping" between providers if failover thresholds are too sensitive or recovery detection is poor.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Failover thresholds, primary provider health monitoring, recovery detection logic.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate intermittent primary provider issues (short bursts of errors/latency around the failover threshold).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Failover logic implemented.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The system does not rapidly switch back and forth ("flap") between providers. Failback to primary should occur only after a stable recovery period.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor logs for frequent switching between primary and secondary providers under intermittent failure conditions.

* **ID:** TC_R752_FAILOVER_007
* **Category Ref:** R752_PROVIDER_FAILOVER
* **Description:** Verify behavior when no secondary provider is configured for a failing model.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Failover logic, `settings.backend_map`.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate primary provider failure for a model that does *not* have a secondary provider configured.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Failover logic implemented (or if not, testing the default error path). Model configured with no secondary provider.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** If failover logic exists but no fallback is available, the API returns an appropriate error (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable) for the failing model. It doesn't crash or enter an undefined state.
* **Verification Steps:** Check the API response and server logs.

* **ID:** TC_R752_FAILOVER_008
* **Category Ref:** R752_PROVIDER_FAILOVER
* **Description:** Verify failback to the primary provider once it recovers.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Primary provider health monitoring, failback logic.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate primary provider failure, confirm failover to secondary. Then, simulate primary provider recovery.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Failover and failback logic implemented.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Once the primary provider is detected as healthy again for a sufficient period, new requests for the model are routed back to the primary provider.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor logs for failback decision. Check if subsequent requests are routed to the primary provider after its recovery.
