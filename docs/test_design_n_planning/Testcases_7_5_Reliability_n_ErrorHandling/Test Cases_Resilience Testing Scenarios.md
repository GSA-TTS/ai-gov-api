## Risk Surface: Handling of Downstream Dependency Failures

* **ID:** TC_R756_DEPENDENCY_001
* **Category Ref:** R756_RESILIENCE
* **Description:** Verify API behavior when the database is unavailable, affecting authentication and other DB-dependent operations.
* **Exposure Point(s):** All protected endpoints. Database dependencies: `app/db/session.py`, `app/auth/repositories.py`, `app/auth/dependencies.py`. Health check `app/routers/root.py`.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate database unavailability (e.g., stop DB service).
    1. Attempt to access a protected endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/models`).
    2. Attempt to access the health check endpoint.
    3. Attempt an operation that writes to the database (e.g., user creation if applicable).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to simulate database unavailability.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** API returns a clear error message (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable). For protected endpoints, authentication fails gracefully. The health check accurately reports unhealthy status due to DB. API does not crash and recovers when DB is restored. Non-critical async tasks (like billing if queued) might show errors in logs but should not bring down primary request flow.
* **Verification Steps:** Check API response codes (expect 503 or appropriate auth failure code). Check health status. Review server logs for graceful error handling. Verify API functionality upon DB restoration.

* **ID:** TC_R756_DEPENDENCY_002
* **Category Ref:** R756_RESILIENCE
* **Description:** Verify API behavior during LLM Provider outages when failover/circuit breaker is not triggered or not applicable.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Provider interaction logic in `app/providers/*`. General error handling.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a complete outage of a specific LLM provider (e.g., Bedrock or Vertex AI) that the API tries to connect to, assuming no failover or circuit breaker stops the attempt.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to simulate provider outage (e.g., network block or mock to always fail).
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API returns a helpful error message (e.g., 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable, or 504 Gateway Timeout) rather than an unhandled exception or misleading error. The error should indicate a problem with the downstream service.
* **Verification Steps:** Inspect API response code and body. Check server logs for errors.

* **ID:** TC_R756_DEPENDENCY_003
* **Category Ref:** R756_RESILIENCE
* **Description:** Verify impact of billing service failure on primary API request flow and data loss potential.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Billing service (`app/services/billing.py:10-14` async queue).
* **Test Method/Action:**
    1. Simulate the billing queue (`asyncio.Queue`) being unavailable or `billing_worker` consistently failing to process items.
    2. Perform API operations that trigger billing events.
    3. Simulate ungraceful shutdown (`app/services/billing.py:18-19` notes this risk).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to simulate billing queue/worker failure or ungraceful shutdown.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Primary API requests (e.g., chat completions) should still succeed even if the asynchronous billing task encounters errors. Errors in billing are logged. For ungraceful shutdown, assess if there's a mechanism to mitigate data loss (e.g., `drain_billing_queue` effectiveness).
* **Verification Steps:** Verify primary API calls succeed. Check server logs for billing errors. Assess billing data integrity after simulated failures and shutdowns (e.g., are records missing).

* **ID:** TC_R756_DEPENDENCY_004
* **Category Ref:** R756_RESILIENCE
* **Description:** Verify comprehensive dependency health checks for graceful degradation.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Health check implementation. Logic for graceful degradation based on health status.
* **Test Method/Action:** Induce failures in various dependencies (DB, specific providers) and check the output of the health check endpoint. Observe if the API degrades gracefully (e.g., disables certain features dependent on the unhealthy component).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Health checks cover all critical dependencies. (Current analysis notes: "Missing comprehensive dependency health checks").
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** Health check endpoint accurately reflects the status of all critical dependencies. If graceful degradation is implemented, observe that the API limits functionality appropriately when a dependency is unhealthy, rather than failing outright.
* **Verification Steps:** Call health check endpoint during simulated dependency failures. Test API functionality to see if it degrades or returns specific errors for affected parts.

## Risk Surface: System Behavior under Multi-Failure or Cascading Failure Scenarios

* **ID:** TC_R756_CASCADE_001
* **Category Ref:** R756_RESILIENCE
* **Description:** Test system behavior when multiple components fail simultaneously or in sequence (e.g., provider slow, causing connection pool exhaustion, impacting DB access).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Entire application stack. Resource management (connection pools for DB/providers), async task management.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a combination of failures:
    1.  An LLM provider becomes very slow (high latency).
    2.  Simultaneously, induce high load on the API.
    3.  While the above are active, simulate a brief database slowdown.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Ability to simulate these multi-failure scenarios and high load. (Current analysis notes: "No visible connection pool configuration", "Resource Management Gaps").
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The system remains stable, even if performance is degraded. Localized failures do not escalate to system-wide outages. Resource limits (if implemented) prevent exhaustion. Recovery occurs when conditions improve. Clear error messages are provided for failing requests.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, connections). Observe API responsiveness and error rates. Check logs for cascading error details and recovery attempts.

* **ID:** TC_R756_CASCADE_002
* **Category Ref:** R756_RESILIENCE
* **Description:** Test for resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, connections) due to cascading effects (e.g., retries from one failure impacting another service).
* **Exposure Point(s):** Retry logic, connection management, memory usage per request.
* **Test Method/Action:** Simulate a scenario where a downstream service frequently returns retryable errors, while the API is under moderate load.
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. Retry logic is active. Ability to simulate persistent retryable errors and apply load.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The API does not run out of resources (connections, memory, CPU). Retries are bounded. Requests not involved with the failing service continue to be processed if resources allow. Rate limiting or load shedding mechanisms (if any) activate.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor server resource utilization. Check API responsiveness to other requests.

* **ID:** TC_R756_CASCADE_003
* **Category Ref:** R756_RESILIENCE
* **Description:** Test for deadlocks or race conditions emerging under complex failure states.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Concurrency handling, shared resource access, async operations.
* **Test Method/Action:** Apply high concurrent load with simulated intermittent failures in multiple dependencies (DB, providers).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running. High concurrency test tools. Ability to simulate intermittent failures.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The system does not deadlock. Race conditions do not lead to data corruption or inconsistent states. Requests are processed, fail gracefully, or timeout.
* **Verification Steps:** Monitor for hung requests or processes. Check data integrity if applicable. Review logs for signs of deadlocks or race condition errors.

* **ID:** TC_R756_CASCADE_004
* **Category Ref:** R756_RESILIENCE
* **Description:** Verify effectiveness of fault isolation mechanisms.
* **Exposure Point(s):** Async decoupling (e.g., `app/services/billing.py`), per-request resource allocation, error handling boundaries.
* **Test Method/Action:** Induce a severe failure in one part of the system (e.g., one provider adapter having an unrecoverable bug, or the billing service crashing repeatedly).
* **Prerequisites:** API is running.
* **Expected Reliable Outcome:** The failure is isolated. Other parts of the API (e.g., requests to different providers, or core API functions not dependent on the failing component) continue to operate normally or degrade gracefully with clear errors. The entire application does not crash.
* **Verification Steps:** Test functionality unrelated to the induced failure point. Monitor overall application stability.
